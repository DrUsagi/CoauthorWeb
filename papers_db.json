However, the analysis of\nsuch data possess vast challenges. One of these relates to the explainability\nof artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning methods. Currently, many of\nsuch methods are non-transparent with respect to their working mechanism and\nfor this reason are called black box models, most notably deep learning\nmethods. However, it has been realized that this constitutes severe problems\nfor a number of fields including the health sciences and criminal justice and\narguments have been brought forward in favor of an explainable AI. In this\npaper, we do not assume the usual perspective presenting explainable AI as it\nshould be, but rather we provide a discussion what explainable AI can be.

Impressive\nexamples of this development can be found in domains such as image\nclassification, sentiment analysis, speech understanding or strategic game\nplaying. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly\nsuccessful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually\napplied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what\nexactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency\ncan be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of\nmethods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has\nrecently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent\ndevelopments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in\nartificial intelligence. Furthermore, it presents two approaches to explaining\npredictions of deep learning models, one method which computes the sensitivity\nof the prediction with respect to changes in the input and one approach which\nmeaningfully decomposes the decision in terms of the input variables.

      "abstract": "In current deep network architectures, deeper layers in networks tend to\ncontain hundreds of independent neurons which makes it hard for humans to\nunderstand how they interact with each other. By organizing the neurons by\ncorrelation, humans can observe how clusters of neighbouring neurons interact\nwith each other. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for back\npropagation, called Locality Guided Neural Network(LGNN) for training networks\nthat preserves locality between neighbouring neurons within each layer of a\ndeep network. Heavily motivated by Self-Organizing Map (SOM), the goal is to\nenforce a local topology on each layer of a deep network such that neighbouring\nneurons are highly correlated with each other. This method contributes to the\ndomain of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aims to alleviate\nthe black-box nature of current AI methods and make them understandable by\nhumans. Our method aims to achieve XAI in deep learning without changing the\nstructure of current models nor requiring any post processing. This paper\nfocuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but can theoretically be\napplied to any type of deep learning architecture. In our experiments, we train\nvarious VGG and Wide ResNet (WRN) networks for image classification on\nCIFAR100.

This article discusses the unique needs of pediatric\nophthalmology patients and how AI techniques can address these challenges,\nsurveys recent applications of AI to pediatric ophthalmology, and discusses\nfuture directions in the field.\n  RECENT FINDINGS: The most significant advances involve the automated\ndetection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yielding results that rival\nexperts. Machine learning (ML) has also been successfully applied to the\nclassification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of post-operative\ncomplications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and\nrefractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading\ndisability via eye tracking. In addition, ML techniques have been used for the\nstudy of visual development, vessel segmentation in pediatric fundus images,\nand ophthalmic image synthesis.\n  SUMMARY: AI applications could significantly benefit clinical care for\npediatric ophthalmology patients by optimizing disease detection and grading,\nbroadening access to care, furthering scientific discovery, and improving\nclinical efficiency. These methods need to match or surpass physician\nperformance in clinical trials before deployment with patients. Due to\nwidespread use of closed-access data sets and software implementations, it is\ndifficult to directly compare the performance of these approaches, and\nreproducibility is poor. Open-access data sets and software implementations\ncould alleviate these issues, and encourage further AI applications to\npediatric ophthalmology.\n  KEYWORDS: pediatric ophthalmology, machine learning, artificial intelligence,\ndeep learning",

These tools are typically employed on medical data (i.e., image,\nmolecular data, clinical variables, etc.) and used the statistical and machine\nlearning methods to measure the model performance. In this review, we\nsummarized and discussed the most recent radiomic pipeline used for clinical\nanalysis. Recent findings:Currently, limited management of cancers benefits\nfrom artificial intelligence, mostly related to a computer-aided diagnosis that\navoids a biopsy analysis that presents additional risks and costs. Most AI\ntools are based on imaging features, known as radiomic analysis that can be\nrefined into predictive models in non-invasively acquired imaging data. This\nreview explores the progress of AI-based radiomic tools for clinical\napplications with a brief description of necessary technical steps. Explaining\nnew radiomic approaches based on deep learning techniques will explain how the\nnew radiomic models (deep radiomic analysis) can benefit from deep\nconvolutional neural networks and be applied on limited data sets.

      "abstract": "In the last years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable\nmomentum that may deliver the best of expectations over many application\nsectors across the field. For this to occur, the entire community stands in\nfront of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of AI techniques\nbrought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not\npresent in the last hype of AI. Paradigms underlying this problem fall within\nthe so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial\nfeature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the\nexisting literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is\nyet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in\nMachine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual\npropositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is\nsought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions\nrelated to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including\nthose aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This\nliterature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced\nby XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability. Our\nprospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence,\nnamely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real\norganizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its\ncore. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to XAI with a reference\nmaterial in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage\nexperts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI\nin their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of\ninterpretability.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) research has become more\ncomputationally intensive. However, a growing concern is that due to unequal\naccess to computing power, only certain firms and elite universities have\nadvantages in modern AI research. Using a novel dataset of 171394 papers from\n57 prestigious computer science conferences, we document that firms, in\nparticular, large technology firms and elite universities have increased\nparticipation in major AI conferences since deep learning's unanticipated rise\nin 2012. The effect is concentrated among elite universities, which are ranked\n1-50 in the QS World University Rankings. Further, we find two strategies\nthrough which firms increased their presence in AI research: first, they have\nincreased firm-only publications; and second, firms are collaborating primarily\nwith elite universities. Consequently, this increased presence of firms and\nelite universities in AI research has crowded out mid-tier (QS ranked 201-300)\nand lower-tier (QS ranked 301-500) universities. To provide causal evidence\nthat deep learning's unanticipated rise resulted in this divergence, we\nleverage the generalized synthetic control method, a data-driven counterfactual\nestimator. Using machine learning based text analysis methods, we provide\nadditional evidence that the divergence between these two groups - large firms\nand non-elite universities - is driven by access to computing power or compute,\nwhich we term as the \"compute divide\". This compute divide between large firms\nand non-elite universities increases concerns around bias and fairness within\nAI technology, and presents an obstacle towards \"democratizing\" AI. These\nresults suggest that a lack of access to specialized equipment such as compute\ncan de-democratize knowledge production.",

      "abstract": "Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models based on artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as fast and reliable tools for predicting water quality index (WQI) in various regions worldwide. In this study, we propose a novel stacking framework based on DL models for WQI prediction, employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Additionally, we introduce explainable AI (XAI) through XGBoost-based SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to gain valuable insights that can enhance decision-making strategies in water management. Our findings demonstrate that the stacking model achieves the highest accuracy in WQI prediction (R2: 0.99, MAPE: 15.99%), outperforming the CNN model (R2: 0.90, MAPE: 58.97%). Although the CNN model shows a relatively high R2 value, other statistical measures indicate that it is actually the worst-performing model among the five tested. This discrepancy may be attributed to the limited training data available for the CNN model. Furthermore, the application of explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically XGBoost-based SHAP values, allows us to gain deep insights into the models and extract valuable information for water management purposes. The SHAP values and interaction plot reveal that elevated levels of total dissolved solids (TDS), zinc, and electrical conductivity (EC) are the primary drivers of poor water quality. These parameters exhibit a nonlinear relationship with the water quality index, implying that even minor increases in their concentrations can significantly impact water quality. Overall, this study presents a comprehensive and integrated approach to water management, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts among all stakeholders to mitigate pollution levels and uphold water quality. By leveraging AI and XAI, our proposed framework not only provides a powerful tool for accurate WQI prediction but also offers deep insights into the models, enabling informed decision-making in water management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recent performance breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially advances in deep learning, the availability of powerful and easy-to-use ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), and increasing computational power, have led to unprecedented interest in AI/ML among nuclear engineers. For physics-based computational models, verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) processes have been very widely investigated, and many methodologies have been developed. However, VVUQ of ML models has been relatively less studied, especially in nuclear engineering. This work focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) of ML models as a preliminary step of ML VVUQ, more specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) because they are the most widely used supervised ML algorithm for both regression and classification tasks. This work aims at quantifying the prediction or approximation uncertainties of DNNs when they are used as surrogate models for expensive physical models. Three techniques for UQ of DNNs are compared, namely, Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Deep Ensembles (DE), and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Two nuclear engineering examples are used to benchmark these methods: (1) time-dependent fission gas release data using the Bison code and (2) void fraction simulation based on the Boiling Water Reactor Full-size Fine-Mesh Bundle Tests (BFBT) benchmark using the TRACE code. It is found that the three methods typically require different DNN architectures and hyperparameters to optimize their performance. The UQ results also depend on the amount of training data available and the nature of the data. Overall, all three methods can provide reasonable estimations of the approximation uncertainties. The uncertainties are generally smaller when the mean predictions are close to the test data while the BNN methods usually produce larger uncertainties than MCD and DE.",

Since the production of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cell lineages generally requires massive and time-consuming laboratory work, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach that can facilitate the cell classification and recognize the cell differentiation degree is of critical demand. In this study, we propose the multi-slice tensor model, a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify iPSC-derived cells and evaluate the differentiation efficiency of iPSC-RPEs. We removed the fully connected layers and projected the features using principle component analysis (PCA), and subsequently classified iPSC-RPEs according to various differentiation degree. With the assistance of the support vector machine (SVM), this model further showed capabilities to classify iPSCs, iPSC-MSCs, iPSC-RPEs, and iPSC-RGCs with an accuracy of 97.8%. In addition, the proposed model accurately recognized the differentiation of iPSC-RPEs and showed the potential to identify the candidate cells with ideal features and simultaneously exclude cells with immature/abnormal phenotypes. This rapid screening/classification system may facilitate the translation of iPSC-based technologies into clinical uses, such as cell transplantation therapy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Real-time evaluations of the severity of depressive symptoms are of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In clinical practice, the evaluation approaches are mainly based on psychological scales and doctor-patient interviews, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Also, the accuracy of results mainly depends on the subjective judgment of the clinician. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more and more machine learning methods are used to diagnose depression by appearance characteristics. Most of the previous research focused on the study of single-modal data; however, in recent years, many studies have shown that multi-modal data has better prediction performance than single-modal data. This study aimed to develop a measurement of depression severity from expression and action features and to assess its validity among the patients with MDD. Methods We proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in real-time, which was based on the detection of patients’ facial expression and body movement from videos captured by ordinary cameras. We established behavioral depression degree (BDD) metrics, which combines expression entropy and action entropy to measure the depression severity of MDD patients. Results We found that the information extracted from different modes, when integrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy of the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies. This method presented an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). In addition, we tracked and evaluated the changes of BDD in patients at different stages of a course of treatment and the results obtained were in agreement with the evaluation from the scales. Discussion The BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients’ depression and its changing trend according to the patient’s expression and action features. Our model may provide an automatic auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD.",

These inspections are recorded in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and the respective state’s databases to manage, study, and analyze the data. As FHWA specifications become more complex, inspections require more training and field time. Recently, element-level inspections were added, assigning a condition state to each minor element in the bridge. To address this new requirement, a machine-aided bridge inspection method was developed using artificial intelligence (AI) to assist inspectors. The proposed method focuses on the condition state assessment of cracking in reinforced concrete bridge deck elements. The deep learning-based workflow integrated with image classification and semantic segmentation methods is utilized to extract information from images and evaluate the condition state of cracks according to FHWA specifications. The new workflow uses a deep neural network to extract information required by the bridge inspection manual, enabling the determination of the condition state of cracks in the deck. The results of experimentation demonstrate the effectiveness of this workflow for this application. The method also balances the costs and risks associated with increasing levels of AI involvement, enabling inspectors to better manage their resources. This AI-based method can be implemented by asset owners, such as Departments of Transportation, to better serve communities.",

      "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition (FER) stands as a pivotal artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology that exploits the capabilities of computer-vision techniques for decoding and comprehending emotional expressions displayed on human faces. With the use of machine-learning (ML) models, specifically deep neural networks (DNN), FER empowers the automatic detection and classification of a broad spectrum of emotions, encompassing surprise, happiness, sadness, anger, and more. Challenges in FER include handling variations in lighting, poses, and facial expressions, as well as ensuring that the model generalizes well to various emotions and populations. This study introduces an automated facial emotion recognition using the pelican optimization algorithm with a deep convolutional neural network (AFER-POADCNN) model. The primary objective of the AFER-POADCNN model lies in the automatic recognition and classification of facial emotions. To accomplish this, the AFER-POADCNN model exploits the median-filtering (MF) approach to remove the noise present in it. Furthermore, the capsule-network (CapsNet) approach can be applied to the feature-extraction process, allowing the model to capture intricate facial expressions and nuances. To optimize the CapsNet model’s performance, hyperparameter tuning is undertaken with the aid of the pelican optimization algorithm (POA). This ensures that the model is finely tuned to detect a wide array of emotions and generalizes effectively across diverse populations and scenarios. Finally, the detection and classification of different kinds of facial emotions take place using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. The simulation analysis of the AFER-POADCNN system is tested on a benchmark FER dataset. The comparative result analysis showed the better performance of the AFER-POADCNN algorithm over existing models, with a maximum accuracy of 99.05%.",

      "abstract": "Creating machines that behave and work in a way similar to humans is the objective of artificial intelligence (AI). In addition to pattern recognition, planning, and problem-solving, computer activities with artificial intelligence include other activities. A group of algorithms called “deep learning” is used in machine learning. With the aid of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), deep learning is utilized to create models for the detection and categorization of brain tumors. This allows for the quick and simple identification of brain tumors. Brain disorders are mostly the result of aberrant brain cell proliferation, which can harm the structure of the brain and ultimately result in malignant brain cancer. The early identification of brain tumors and the subsequent appropriate treatment may lower the death rate. In this study, we suggest a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the efficient identification of brain tumors using MR images. This paper also discusses various models such as ResNet-50, VGG16, and Inception V3 and conducts a comparison between the proposed architecture and these models. To analyze the performance of the models, we considered different metrics such as the accuracy, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC). As a result of analyzing different models with our proposed model using these metrics, we concluded that the proposed model performed better than the others. Using a dataset of 3264 MR images, we found that the CNN model had an accuracy of 93.3%, an AUC of 98.43%, a recall of 91.19%, and a loss of 0.25. We may infer that the proposed model is reliable for the early detection of a variety of brain tumors after comparing it to the other models.",

The potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in its prevention and treatment is firmly recognized. Indeed, AI application allows personalized medicine and tailored treatment for each patient. Specifically, this article reviews the benefits of AI in AH management, pointing out diagnostic and therapeutic improvements without ignoring the limitations of this innovative scientific approach. Consequently, we conducted a detailed search on AI applications in AH: the articles (quantitative and qualitative) reviewed in this paper were obtained by searching journal databases such as PubMed and subject-specific professional websites, including Google Scholar. The search terms included artificial intelligence, artificial neural network, deep learning, machine learning, big data, arterial hypertension, blood pressure, blood pressure measurement, cardiovascular disease, and personalized medicine. Specifically, AI-based systems could help continuously monitor BP using wearable technologies; in particular, BP can be estimated from a photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal obtained from a smartphone or a smartwatch using DL. Furthermore, thanks to ML algorithms, it is possible to identify new hypertension genes for the early diagnosis of AH and the prevention of complications. Moreover, integrating AI with omics-based technologies will lead to the definition of the trajectory of the hypertensive patient and the use of the most appropriate drug. However, AI is not free from technical issues and biases, such as over/underfitting, the “black-box” nature of many ML algorithms, and patient data privacy. In conclusion, AI-based systems will change clinical practice for AH by identifying patient trajectories for new, personalized care plans and predicting patients’ risks and necessary therapy adjustments due to changes in disease progression and/or therapy response.",

      "abstract": "Information field theory (IFT), the information theory for fields, is a\nmathematical framework for signal reconstruction and non-parametric inverse\nproblems. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) aim at\ngenerating intelligent systems including such for perception, cognition, and\nlearning. This overlaps with IFT, which is designed to address perception,\nreasoning, and inference tasks. Here, the relation between concepts and tools\nin IFT and those in AI and ML research are discussed. In the context of IFT,\nfields denote physical quantities that change continuously as a function of\nspace (and time) and information theory refers to Bayesian probabilistic logic\nequipped with the associated entropic information measures. Reconstructing a\nsignal with IFT is a computational problem similar to training a generative\nneural network (GNN) in ML. In this paper, the process of inference in IFT is\nreformulated in terms of GNN training. In contrast to classical neural\nnetworks, IFT based GNNs can operate without pre-training thanks to\nincorporating expert knowledge into their architecture. Furthermore, the\ncross-fertilization of variational inference methods used in IFT and ML are\ndiscussed. These discussions suggests that IFT is well suited to address many\nproblems in AI and ML research and application.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in healthcare\ndelivery, this chapter explores the critical aspects of developing reliable and\nethical Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Beginning with the\nfundamental transition from traditional statistical models to sophisticated\nmachine learning approaches, this work examines rigorous validation strategies\nand performance assessment methods, including the crucial role of model\ncalibration and decision curve analysis. The chapter emphasizes that creating\ntrustworthy AI systems in healthcare requires more than just technical\naccuracy; it demands careful consideration of fairness, explainability, and\nprivacy. The challenge of ensuring equitable healthcare delivery through AI is\nstressed, discussing methods to identify and mitigate bias in clinical\npredictive models. The chapter then delves into explainability as a cornerstone\nof human-centered CDSS. This focus reflects the understanding that healthcare\nprofessionals must not only trust AI recommendations but also comprehend their\nunderlying reasoning. The discussion advances in an analysis of privacy\nvulnerabilities in medical AI systems, from data leakage in deep learning\nmodels to sophisticated attacks against model explanations. The text explores\nprivacy-preservation strategies such as differential privacy and federated\nlearning, while acknowledging the inherent trade-offs between privacy\nprotection and model performance. This progression, from technical validation\nto ethical considerations, reflects the multifaceted challenges of developing\nAI systems that can be seamlessly and reliably integrated into daily clinical\npractice while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and data\nprotection.",

      "abstract": "Computationally explicit hypotheses of brain function derived from machine\nlearning (ML)-based models have recently revolutionized neuroscience. Despite\nthe unprecedented ability of these artificial neural networks (ANNs) to capture\nresponses in biological neural networks (brains), and our full access to all\ninternal model components (unlike the brain), ANNs are often referred to as\nblack-boxes with limited interpretability. Interpretability, however, is a\nmulti-faceted construct that is used differently across fields. In particular,\ninterpretability, or explainability, efforts in Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nfocus on understanding how different model components contribute to its output\n(i.e., decision making). In contrast, the neuroscientific interpretability of\nANNs requires explicit alignment between model components and neuroscientific\nconstructs (e.g., different brain areas or phenomena, like recurrence or\ntop-down feedback). Given the widespread calls to improve the interpretability\nof AI systems, we here highlight these different notions of interpretability\nand argue that the neuroscientific interpretability of ANNs can be pursued in\nparallel with, but independently from, the ongoing efforts in AI. Certain ML\ntechniques (e.g., deep dream) can be leveraged in both fields, to ask what\nstimulus optimally activates the specific model features (feature visualization\nby optimization), or how different features contribute to the model's output\n(feature attribution). However, without appropriate brain alignment, certain\nfeatures will remain uninterpretable to neuroscientists.",

We are convinced that our approach can serve as\nthe foundation for the certification of applications that use Machine Learning\nand Deep Learning, the techniques that drive the current revolution in\nArtificial Intelligence. While certain high-risk areas, such as fully\nautonomous robots in workspaces shared with humans, are still some time away\nfrom certification, we aim to cover low-risk applications with our\ncertification procedure. Our holistic approach attempts to analyze Machine\nLearning applications from multiple perspectives to evaluate and verify the\naspects of secure software development, functional requirements, data quality,\ndata protection, and ethics. Inspired by existing work, we introduce four\ncriticality levels to map the criticality of a Machine Learning application\nregarding the impact of its decisions on people, environment, and\norganizations.

Method: Electronic search was performed using\nMedline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest. Studies that\nexamined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis\nof COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity,\nspecificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated.\nResult: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues,\nincluding disease severity, mechanical ventilation or admission to the\nintensive care unit and mortality, were investigated. Several AI models and\narchitectures were employed, such as the Siamense model, support vector\nmachine, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and convolutional neural\nnetworks. The models achieved 71%, 88% and 67% sensitivity for mortality,\nseverity assessment and need for ventilation, respectively. The specificity of\n69%, 89% and 89% were reported for the aforementioned variables. Conclusion:\nBased on the included articles, machine learning and deep learning methods used\nfor the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using radiomic features from CT or CXR\nimages can help clinicians manage patients and allocate resources more\neffectively. These studies also demonstrate that combining patient demographic,\nclinical data, laboratory tests and radiomic features improves model\nperformances.",

Several\nreviews have been conducted regarding Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques\nto improve pregnancy outcomes. They are limited by focusing on specific data\nsuch as mother's care during pregnancy. This systematic survey aims to explore\nhow artificial intelligence (AI) can assist with fetal growth monitoring via\nUltrasound (US) image. We used eight medical and computer science bibliographic\ndatabases, including PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, IEEE explore, ACM\nLibrary, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science. We retrieved studies published\nbetween 2010 to 2021. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using a\nnarrative approach. Out of 1269 retrieved studies, we included 107 distinct\nstudies from queries that were relevant to the topic in the survey. We found\nthat 2D ultrasound images were more popular (n=88) than 3D and 4D ultrasound\nimages (n=19). Classification is the most used method (n=42), followed by\nsegmentation (n=31), classification integrated with segmentation (n=16) and\nother miscellaneous such as object-detection, regression and reinforcement\nlearning (n=18). The most common areas within the pregnancy domain were the\nfetus head (n=43), then fetus body (n=31), fetus heart (n=13), fetus abdomen\n(n=10), and lastly the fetus face (n=10). In the most recent studies, deep\nlearning techniques were primarily used (n=81), followed by machine learning\n(n=16), artificial neural network (n=7), and reinforcement learning (n=2). AI\ntechniques played a crucial role in predicting fetal diseases and identifying\nfetus anatomy structures during pregnancy. More research is required to\nvalidate this technology from a physician's perspective, such as pilot studies\nand randomized controlled trials on AI and its applications in a hospital\nsetting.",

The target variable, mainly in the first\nAugust fortnight, can contain signals of extreme events such as heatwaves, like\nthe mega-heatwave of 2003, which affected France and the Iberian Peninsula.\nThus, an accurate prediction of long-term air temperature may be valuable also\nfor different problems related to climate change, such as attribution of\nextreme events, and in other problems related to renewable energy. The analysis\ncarried out this work is based on Reanalysis data, which are first processed by\na correlation analysis among different prediction variables and the target\n(average air temperature in August first and second fortnights). An area with\nthe largest correlation is located, and the variables within, after a feature\nselection process, are the input of different deep learning and ML algorithms.\nThe experiments carried out show a very good prediction skill in the three\nproposed AI frameworks, both in Paris and C\\'ordoba regions.",

The virus rapidly spread across the globe,\nleading to a high rate of mortality, which prompted health organizations to\ntake measures to control its transmission. Early disease detection is crucial\nin the treatment process, and computer-based automatic detection systems have\nbeen developed to aid in this effort. These systems often rely on artificial\nintelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning, neural networks, fuzzy\nsystems, and deep learning to classify diseases. This study aimed to\ndifferentiate COVID-19 patients from others using self-categorizing classifiers\nand employing various AI methods. This study used two datasets: the blood test\nsamples and radiography images. The best results for the blood test samples\nobtained from San Raphael Hospital, which include two classes of individuals,\nthose with COVID-19 and those with non-COVID diseases, were achieved through\nthe use of the Ensemble method (a combination of a neural network and two\nmachines learning methods). The results showed that this approach for COVID-19\ndiagnosis is cost-effective and provides results in a shorter amount of time\nthan other methods. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 94.09% on the\ndataset used. Secondly, the radiographic images were divided into four classes:\nnormal, viral pneumonia, ground glass opacity, and COVID-19 infection. These\nwere used for segmentation and classification. The lung lobes were extracted\nfrom the images and then categorized into specific classes. We achieved an\naccuracy of 91.1% on the image dataset. Generally, this study highlights the\npotential of AI in detecting and managing COVID-19 and underscores the\nimportance of continued research and development in this field.",

Recently, abundant research has been devoted to obtaining\nreaction coordinates using artificial neural networks from deep learning\nliterature, where many collective variables are typically utilized in the input\nlayer. However, it is difficult to explain the details of which collective\nvariables contribute to the predicted reaction coordinates owing to the\ncomplexity of the nonlinear functions in deep neural networks.

We demonstrated that\nXAI enables us to obtain the degree of contribution of each collective variable\nto reaction coordinates that is determined by nonlinear regressions with deep\nlearning for the committor of the alanine dipeptide isomerization in vacuum. In\nparticular, both LIME and SHAP provide important features to the predicted\nreaction coordinates, which are characterized by appropriate dihedral angles\nconsistent with those previously reported from the committor test analysis.

Thus, the potential\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Deep Learning (DL), to process\ncamera-trap data has gained considerable attention. Using DL for these\napplications involves training algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), to automatically detect objects and classify species. To\novercome technical challenges associated with training CNNs, several research\ncommunities have recently developed platforms that incorporate DL in\neasy-to-use interfaces. We review key characteristics of four AI-powered\nplatforms -- Wildlife Insights (WI), MegaDetector (MD), Machine Learning for\nWildlife Image Classification (MLWIC2), and Conservation AI -- including data\nmanagement tools and AI features. We also provide R code in an open-source\nGitBook, to demonstrate how users can evaluate model performance, and\nincorporate AI output in semi-automated workflows. We found that species\nclassifications from WI and MLWIC2 generally had low recall values (animals\nthat were present in the images often were not classified to the correct\nspecies). Yet, the precision of WI and MLWIC2 classifications for some species\nwas high (i.e., when classifications were made, they were generally accurate).\nMD, which classifies images using broader categories (e.g., \"blank\" or\n\"animal\"), also performed well. Thus, we conclude that, although species\nclassifiers were not accurate enough to automate image processing, DL could be\nused to improve efficiencies by accepting classifications with high confidence\nvalues for certain species or by filtering images containing blanks.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of neutrino oscillation, proving that neutrinos do have masses,\nreveals the misfits of particles in the current Standard Model (SM) theory. In\ntheory, neutrinos having masses could result in lepton flavour not being a\nsymmetry called Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV). While SM theory extensions\nallowed LFV processes, their branching fractions are too small, making them\nunobservable even with the strongest equipment up-to-date. With that,\nscientists in recent years have generated LFV-like processes from the combined\nLHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated data in an attempt to identify LFV using\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep\nLearning (DL). In this paper, the performance of several algorithms in AI has\nbeen presented, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, custom 1-D Dense Block Neural\nNetworks (DBNNs), and custom 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in\nidentifying LFV signals, specifically $\\tau^{-} \\rightarrow\n\\mu^{-}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}$ decay from the combined LHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated\ndata that imitates the signatures of the said decay. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)\nand Cramer-von Mises (CvM) tests were also conducted to verify the validity of\npredictions for each of the trained algorithms. The result shows decent\nperformances among algorithms, except for the LightGBM, for failing the CvM\ntest, and a 20-layered CNN for having recorded a considerably low AUC.\nMeanwhile, XGBoost and a 10-layered DBNN recorded the highest AUC of 0.88. The\nmain contribution of this paper is the extensive experiment involving custom\nDBNN and CNN algorithms in different layers, all of which have been rarely used\nin the past years in identifying LFV-like signatures, unlike GBMs and\ntree-based algorithms, which have been more popular in the said task.",

We foresee that, in the near\nfuture, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or\ncollaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the\nsuccesses of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is\nthe `creator', remain modest.

Subsequently, we have witnessed\nfast-growing literature of research that applies AI to extract audiovisual\nnon-verbal cues for mental illness assessment. However, the majority of the\nrecent works focus on depression, despite the evident difference between\ndepression symptoms and suicidal behavior and non-verbal cues. This paper\nreviews recent works that study suicide ideation and suicide behavior detection\nthrough audiovisual feature analysis, mainly suicidal voice/speech acoustic\nfeatures analysis and suicidal visual cues. Automatic suicide assessment is a\npromising research direction that is still in the early stages. Accordingly,\nthere is a lack of large datasets that can be used to train machine learning\nand deep learning models proven to be effective in other, similar tasks.",

We support this claim by\nanalyzing the recent advances of the field. Regarding integration, we note that\nthe most impactful recent contributions have been made possible through the\nintegration of recent Machine Learning methods (based in particular on Deep\nLearning and Recurrent Neural Networks) with more traditional ones (e.g.\nMonte-Carlo tree search, goal babbling exploration or addressable memory\nsystems). Regarding embodiment, we note that the traditional benchmark tasks\n(e.g. visual classification or board games) are becoming obsolete as\nstate-of-the-art learning algorithms approach or even surpass human performance\nin most of them, having recently encouraged the development of first-person 3D\ngame platforms embedding realistic physics. Building upon this analysis, we\nfirst propose an embodied cognitive architecture integrating heterogenous\nsub-fields of Artificial Intelligence into a unified framework. We demonstrate\nthe utility of our approach by showing how major contributions of the field can\nbe expressed within the proposed framework. We then claim that benchmarking\nenvironments need to reproduce ecologically-valid conditions for bootstrapping\nthe acquisition of increasingly complex cognitive skills through the concept of\na cognitive arms race between embodied agents.",

At the same\ntime, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of\nmajor advances are frequently in the news.\n  The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common\nthan is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic\nheart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation\nfor the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector\nspaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor\nproduct, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial\nneural networks.\n  This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including\nexamples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in\nautomated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed\ninclude vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal\nprojection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators,\nand tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval,\ncategorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation,\ninference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition.\n  Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware.\nMany of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and\nsome are already realized.

For physics-based computational models, Verification,\nValidation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) have been very widely\ninvestigated and a lot of methodologies have been developed. However, VVUQ of\nML models has been relatively less studied, especially in nuclear engineering.\nIn this work, we focus on UQ of ML models as a preliminary step of ML VVUQ,\nmore specifically, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) because they are the most widely\nused supervised ML algorithm for both regression and classification tasks. This\nwork aims at quantifying the prediction, or approximation uncertainties of DNNs\nwhen they are used as surrogate models for expensive physical models. Three\ntechniques for UQ of DNNs are compared, namely Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Deep\nEnsembles (DE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Two nuclear engineering\nexamples are used to benchmark these methods, (1) time-dependent fission gas\nrelease data using the Bison code, and (2) void fraction simulation based on\nthe BFBT benchmark using the TRACE code. It was found that the three methods\ntypically require different DNN architectures and hyperparameters to optimize\ntheir performance. The UQ results also depend on the amount of training data\navailable and the nature of the data. Overall, all these three methods can\nprovide reasonable estimations of the approximation uncertainties. The\nuncertainties are generally smaller when the mean predictions are close to the\ntest data, while the BNN methods usually produce larger uncertainties than MCD\nand DE.",

Traditional machine learning models were more prevalent than deep\nlearning models. Electronic health records were the most commonly used data\nsource. Unimodal AI models relying on EHR data were prominent, while only a few\nutilized multimodal models. Both unimodal and multimodal models showed\npromising performance, with the latter outperforming the former. Internal\nvalidation was common, while external validation was limited. Interpretability\nmethods were reported in half of the studies. Few studies reported novel\nbiomarkers, and open-source code availability was limited.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces RACER, the Rational Artificial Intelligence\nCar-following model Enhanced by Reality, a cutting-edge deep learning\ncar-following model, that satisfies partial derivative constraints, designed to\npredict Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) driving behavior while staying\ntheoretically feasible. Unlike conventional models, RACER effectively\nintegrates Rational Driving Constraints (RDCs), crucial tenets of actual\ndriving, resulting in strikingly accurate and realistic predictions. Against\nestablished models like the Optimal Velocity Relative Velocity (OVRV), a\ncar-following Neural Network (NN), and a car-following Physics-Informed Neural\nNetwork (PINN), RACER excels across key metrics, such as acceleration,\nvelocity, and spacing. Notably, it displays a perfect adherence to the RDCs,\nregistering zero violations, in stark contrast to other models. This study\nhighlights the immense value of incorporating physical constraints within AI\nmodels, especially for augmenting safety measures in transportation. It also\npaves the way for future research to test these models against human driving\ndata, with the potential to guide safer and more rational driving behavior. The\nversatility of the proposed model, including its potential to incorporate\nadditional derivative constraints and broader architectural applications,\nenhances its appeal and broadens its impact within the scientific community.",

Third, chaos properties can be used to relief inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation. Although recent work has\nreported the method of obtaining the optimal threshold to eliminate the ISI in\nchaos-based wireless communication, its practical implementation is still a\nchallenge.

Our results apply to general multi-class classifiers\nthat map from an input space into a decision space, including artificial neural\nnetworks used in deep learning applications. Two classes of attacks are\nconsidered. The first class involves adversarial examples and concerns the\nintroduction of small perturbations of the input data that cause\nmisclassification. The second class, introduced here for the first time and\nnamed stealth attacks, involves small perturbations to the AI system itself.\nHere the perturbed system produces whatever output is desired by the attacker\non a specific small data set, perhaps even a single input, but performs as\nnormal on a validation set (which is unknown to the attacker). We show that in\nboth cases, i.e., in the case of an attack based on adversarial examples and in\nthe case of a stealth attack, the dimensionality of the AI's decision-making\nspace is a major contributor to the AI's susceptibility. For attacks based on\nadversarial examples, a second crucial parameter is the absence of local\nconcentrations in the data probability distribution, a property known as\nSmeared Absolute Continuity. According to our findings, robustness to\nadversarial examples requires either (a) the data distributions in the AI's\nfeature space to have concentrated probability density functions or (b) the\ndimensionality of the AI's decision variables to be sufficiently small. We also\nshow how to construct stealth attacks on high-dimensional AI systems that are\nhard to spot unless the validation set is made exponentially large.",

Objective & Methods: The objective is to perform a scoping\nreview on AI for COVID-19 using preferred reporting items of systematic reviews\nand meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed for\nrelevant studies published from 1 January 2020 till 27 March 2021. Out of 4050\nresearch papers available in reputed publishers, a full-text review of 440\narticles was done based on the keywords of AI, COVID-19, ML, forecasting, DL,\nX-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT). Finally, 52 articles were included in the\nresult synthesis of this paper. As part of the review, different ML regression\nmethods were reviewed first in predicting the number of confirmed and death\ncases. Secondly, a comprehensive survey was carried out on the use of ML in\nclassifying COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, different datasets on medical imaging\nwere compared in terms of the number of images, number of positive samples and\nnumber of classes in the datasets. The different stages of the diagnosis,\nincluding preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction were also\nreviewed. Fourthly, the performance results of different research papers were\ncompared to evaluate the effectiveness of DL methods on different datasets.\nResults: Results show that residual neural network (ResNet-18) and densely\nconnected convolutional network (DenseNet 169) exhibit excellent classification\naccuracy for X-ray images, while DenseNet-201 has the maximum accuracy in\nclassifying CT scan images. This indicates that ML and DL are useful tools in\nassisting researchers and medical professionals in predicting, screening and\ndetecting COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "In recent years fused-multiply-add (FMA) units with lower-precision\nmultiplications and higher-precision accumulation have proven useful in machine\nlearning/artificial intelligence applications, most notably in training deep\nneural networks due to their extreme computational intensity. Compared to\nclassical IEEE-754 32 bit (FP32) and 64 bit (FP64) arithmetic, these reduced\nprecision arithmetic can naturally be sped up disproportional to their\nshortened width. The common strategy of all major hardware vendors is to\naggressively further enhance their performance disproportionately. One\nparticular FMA operation that multiplies two BF16 numbers while accumulating in\nFP32 has been found useful in deep learning, where BF16 is the 16-bit floating\npoint datatype with IEEE FP32 numerical range but 8 significant bits of\nprecision. In this paper, we examine the use this FMA unit to implement\nhigher-precision matrix routines in terms of potential performance gain and\nimplications on accuracy. We demonstrate how a decomposition into multiple\nsmaller datatypes can be used to assemble a high-precision result, leveraging\nthe higher precision accumulation of the FMA unit. We first demonstrate that\ncomputations of vector inner products and by natural extension, matrix-matrix\nproducts can be achieved by decomposing FP32 numbers in several BF16 numbers\nfollowed by appropriate computations that can accommodate the dynamic range and\npreserve accuracy compared to standard FP32 computations, while projecting up\nto 5.2x speed-up. Furthermore, we examine solution of linear equations\nformulated in the residual form that allows for iterative refinement. We\ndemonstrate that the solution obtained to be comparable to those offered by\nFP64 under a large range of linear system condition numbers.",

Artificial intelligence\n(AI) is poised to address these limitations, but the intersection of AI and VCE\nreveals challenges that must first be overcome. We identified five challenges\nto address. Challenge #1: VCE data are stochastic and contains significant\nartifact. Challenge #2: VCE interpretation is cost-intensive. Challenge #3: VCE\ndata are inherently imbalanced. Challenge #4: Existing VCE AIMLT are\ncomputationally cumbersome. Challenge #5: Clinicians are hesitant to accept\nAIMLT that cannot explain their process.\n  Methods: An anatomic landmark detection model was used to test the\napplication of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the task of classifying\nVCE data. We also created a tool that assists in expert annotation of VCE data.\nWe then created more elaborate models using different approaches including a\nmulti-frame approach, a CNN based on graph representation, and a few-shot\napproach based on meta-learning.\n  Results: When used on full-length VCE footage, CNNs accurately identified\nanatomic landmarks (99.1%), with gradient weighted-class activation mapping\nshowing the parts of each frame that the CNN used to make its decision. The\ngraph CNN with weakly supervised learning (accuracy 89.9%, sensitivity of\n91.1%), the few-shot model (accuracy 90.8%, precision 91.4%, sensitivity\n90.9%), and the multi-frame model (accuracy 97.5%, precision 91.5%, sensitivity\n94.8%) performed well. Discussion: Each of these five challenges is addressed,\nin part, by one of our AI-based models. Our goal of producing high performance\nusing lightweight models that aim to improve clinician confidence was achieved.",

However, in light of these rapid advances, addressing the\nunderrepresentation of black communities and African countries in AI is\ncrucial. Boosting enthusiasm for AI can be effectively accomplished by\nshowcasing straightforward applications around tasks like identifying and\ncategorizing traditional symbols, such as Adinkra symbols, or familiar objects\nwithin the community. In this research endeavor, we dived into classical\nmachine learning and harnessed the power of deep learning models to tackle the\nintricate task of classifying and recognizing Adinkra symbols. The idea led to\na newly constructed ADINKRA dataset comprising 174,338 images meticulously\norganized into 62 distinct classes, each representing a singular and emblematic\nsymbol. We constructed a CNN model for classification and recognition using six\nconvolutional layers, three fully connected (FC) layers, and optional dropout\nregularization. The model is a simpler and smaller version of VGG, with fewer\nlayers, smaller channel sizes, and a fixed kernel size. Additionally, we tap\ninto the transfer learning capabilities provided by pre-trained models like VGG\nand ResNet. These models assist us in both classifying images and extracting\nfeatures that can be used with classical machine learning models. We assess the\nmodel's performance by measuring its accuracy and convergence rate and\nvisualizing the areas that significantly influence its predictions. These\nevaluations serve as a foundational benchmark for future assessments of the\nADINKRA dataset.

      "abstract": "In the last two years, the U.S. government has emphasized the importance of\naccelerating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within the\ngovernment and across the nation. In particular, the National Artificial\nIntelligence Initiative Act of 2020, which became law on January 1, 2021,\nprovides for a coordinated program across the entire federal government to\naccelerate AI research and application. The U.S. government can benefit from\npublic artificial intelligence and machine learning challenges through the\ndevelopment of novel algorithms and participation in experiential training.\nAlthough the public, private, and non-profit sectors have a history of\nleveraging crowdsourcing initiatives to generate novel solutions to difficult\nproblems and engage stakeholders, interest in public competitions has waned in\nrecent years as a result of at least three major factors: (1) a lack of\nhigh-quality, high-impact data; (2) a narrow engagement focus on specialized\ngroups; and (3) insufficient operationalization of challenge results. Herein we\nidentify common issues and recommend approaches to increase the effectiveness\nof challenges. To address these barriers, enabling the use of public\ncompetitions for accelerating AI and ML practice, the U.S. government must\nleverage methods that protect sensitive data while enabling modelling, enable\neasier participation, empower deployment of validated models, and incentivize\nengagement from broad sections of the population.",

Most recent developments in artificial intelligence are coming from deep\nlearning, which has proven revolutionary in almost all fields, from computer\nvision to health sciences. The effects of deep learning in medicine have\nchanged the conventional ways of clinical application significantly. Although\nsome sub-fields of medicine, such as pediatrics, have been relatively slow in\nreceiving the critical benefits of deep learning, related research in\npediatrics has started to accumulate to a significant level, too. Hence, in\nthis paper, we review recently developed machine learning and deep\nlearning-based solutions for neonatology applications. We systematically\nevaluate the roles of both classical machine learning and deep learning in\nneonatology applications, define the methodologies, including algorithmic\ndevelopments, and describe the remaining challenges in the assessment of\nneonatal diseases by using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. To date, the primary areas\nof focus in neonatology regarding AI applications have included survival\nanalysis, neuroimaging, analysis of vital parameters and biosignals, and\nretinopathy of prematurity diagnosis. We have categorically summarized 106\nresearch articles from 1996 to 2022 and discussed their pros and cons,\nrespectively.

However, the success of conventional machine learning\ntools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount\nof labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or\nfirst-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are\nexpensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and\nprohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations.\n  We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both\ndata and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum,\nmass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To\nthe best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of PINN to\nthree dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type\napproach for Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function,\nwhich can not only enforce the BCs but also accelerate the learning process.\nThe PINN framework is applied to two representative metal manufacturing\nproblems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series.

The investigations show\nthat the PINN, owed to the additional physical knowledge, can accurately\npredict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal AM processes with\nonly a moderate amount of labeled data-sets.

      "abstract": "1. The popularity of Machine learning (ML), Deep learning (DL), and\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this\nspike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often\nperceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools\nremains debated. 2. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily\nat making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks\ntraditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent\ndiscussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, missing out on synthesizing\nthe wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles.\n3. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL,\nstarting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm\nfamilies, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML\nprinciples. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction\ntasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical\nmethods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for\necological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific\nand causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact\necological data analysis in the future. 4. We conclude that ML and DL are\npowerful new tools for predictive modeling and data analysis. The superior\nperformance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be\nexplained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity\noptimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the\nfocus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the\ninterpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an\nindispensable tool in E&E, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.",

However, it is clear that AI and business models based on it can only\nreach their full potential if AI applications are developed according to high\nquality standards and are effectively protected against new AI risks. For\ninstance, AI bears the risk of unfair treatment of individuals when processing\npersonal data e.g., to support credit lending or staff recruitment decisions.\nThe emergence of these new risks is closely linked to the fact that the\nbehavior of AI applications, particularly those based on Machine Learning (ML),\nis essentially learned from large volumes of data and is not predetermined by\nfixed programmed rules.\n  Thus, the issue of the trustworthiness of AI applications is crucial and is\nthe subject of numerous major publications by stakeholders in politics,\nbusiness and society. In addition, there is mutual agreement that the\nrequirements for trustworthy AI, which are often described in an abstract way,\nmust now be made clear and tangible. One challenge to overcome here relates to\nthe fact that the specific quality criteria for an AI application depend\nheavily on the application context and possible measures to fulfill them in\nturn depend heavily on the AI technology used. Lastly, practical assessment\nprocedures are needed to evaluate whether specific AI applications have been\ndeveloped according to adequate quality standards. This AI assessment catalog\naddresses exactly this point and is intended for two target groups: Firstly, it\nprovides developers with a guideline for systematically making their AI\napplications trustworthy. Secondly, it guides assessors and auditors on how to\nexamine AI applications for trustworthiness in a structured way.",

      "abstract": "Developing strong AI could provide a powerful tool for addressing social and\nscientific challenges. Neural networks (NNs), inspired by biological systems,\nhave the potential to achieve this. However, weight optimization techniques\nusing error backpropagation are not observed in biological systems, raising\ndoubts about current NNs approaches. In this context, Itoh (2024) solved the\nMNIST classification problem without using objective functions or\nbackpropagation. However, weight updates were not used, so it does not qualify\nas machine learning AI. In this study, I develop a machine learning method that\nmimics biological neural systems by implementing Hebbian learning in NNs\nwithout backpropagation and optimization method to solve the MNIST\nclassification problem and analyze its output. Development proceeded in three\nstages. In the first stage, I applied the Hebbian learning rule to the MNIST\ncharacter recognition algorithm by Itoh (2024), resulting in lower accuracy\nthan non-Hebbian NNs, highlighting the limitations of conventional training\nprocedures for Hebbian learning. In the second stage, I examined the properties\nof individually trained NNs using norm-based cognition, showing that NNs\ntrained on a specific label respond powerfully to that label. In the third\nstage, I created an MNIST character recognition program using vector norm\nmagnitude as the criterion, achieving an accuracy of approximately 75%. This\ndemonstrates that the Hebbian learning NNs can recognize handwritten characters\nwithout objective functions, backpropagation, optimization processes, and large\ndata set. Based on these results, developing a mechanism based on norm-based\ncognition as a fundamental unit and then increasing complexity to achieve\nindirect similarity cognition should help mimic biological neural systems and\ncontribute to realizing strong AI.",

Most of the\ntechniques are being applied to the detection of attacks to running systems,\nbut recent improvements in machine learning (for example, in natural language\nprocessing) have enabled the opportunity to process software and specifications\nto detect vulnerabilities in a system before it is deployed. This paper\npresents a survey of artificial intelligence techniques (including machine\nlearning) to detect or repair security vulnerabilities before product\nintroduction. In the surveyed papers, techniques are presented for using NLP to\nanalyze requirements documents for security standard completeness, performing\nneural fuzz testing of software, generating exploits to detect risk, and more.\nWe categorize current techniques into 3 groups: vulnerability detection,\nvulnerability repair, and specification analysis. Generally, while AI\ntechniques have become quite useful in this area, we show that AI techniques\nstill tend to be limited in scope, providing a collection of tools which can\naugment but not replace careful system development to reduce vulnerability\nrisks.",

      "abstract": "Luminescence-based sensors for measuring oxygen concentration are widely used\nboth in industry and research due to the practical advantages and sensitivity\nof this type of sensing. The measuring principle is the luminescence quenching\nby oxygen molecules, which results in a change of the luminescence decay time\nand intensity. In the classical approach, this change is related to an oxygen\nconcentration using the Stern-Volmer equation. This equation, which in most of\nthe cases is non-linear, is parametrized through device-specific constants.\nTherefore, to determine these parameters every sensor needs to be precisely\ncalibrated at one or more known concentrations. This work explores an entirely\nnew artificial intelligence approach and demonstrates the feasibility of oxygen\nsensing through machine learning. The specifically developed neural network\nlearns very efficiently to relate the input quantities to the oxygen\nconcentration. The results show a mean deviation of the predicted from the\nmeasured concentration of 0.5 percent air, comparable to many commercial and\nlow-cost sensors. Since the network was trained using synthetically generated\ndata, the accuracy of the model predictions is limited by the ability of the\ngenerated data to describe the measured data, opening up future possibilities\nfor significant improvement by using a large number of experimental\nmeasurements for training. The approach described in this work demonstrates the\napplicability of artificial intelligence to sensing of sensors.",

Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well\nunderstood, which undermines our ability to discern consensuses or\ndisagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views,\nwe conducted a survey of those who published in the top AI/ML conferences (N =\n524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML\nresearchers (Grace, Salvatier, Dafoe, Zhang, & Evans, 2018) and a 2018 survey\nof the US public (Zhang & Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place\nhigh levels of trust in international organizations and scientific\norganizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest;\nmoderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national\nmilitaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were\noverwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous\nweapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military\napplications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of\nrespondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML\ninstitutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms.\nBeing closer to the technology itself, AI/ML re-searchers are well placed to\nhighlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to\nmeasure their attitudes has broad relevance.

Rural and\nunderserved areas, which suffer from lack of access to experienced\nophthalmologists may particularly benefit from this technology. Quantitative\noptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging provides excellent\ncapability to identify subtle vascular distortions, which are useful for\nclassifying retinovascular diseases. However, application of AI for\ndifferentiation and classification of multiple eye diseases is not yet\nestablished. In this study, we demonstrate supervised machine learning based\nmulti-task OCTA classification. We sought 1) to differentiate normal from\ndiseased ocular conditions, 2) to differentiate different ocular disease\nconditions from each other, and 3) to stage the severity of each ocular\ncondition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT),\nblood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel\ndensity (BVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (FAZ-A), and FAZ contour\nirregularity (FAZ-CI) were fully automatically extracted from the OCTA images.\nA stepwise backward elimination approach was employed to identify sensitive\nOCTA features and optimal-feature-combinations for the multi-task\nclassification. For proof-of-concept demonstration, diabetic retinopathy (DR)\nand sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) were used to validate the supervised machine\nleaning classifier. The presented AI classification methodology is applicable\nand can be readily extended to other ocular diseases, holding promise to enable\na mass-screening platform for clinical deployment and telemedicine.",

To solve the black-box problem of AI, we\npropose eXplicitly eXplainable AI (XXAI) - a fully transparent white-box AI\nbased on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from\nthe first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this\ncase, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for\nderiving the inferences of the cellular automata. A cellular automaton\nimplements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization\n- from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole.

      "abstract": "Our research endeavors to advance the concept of responsible artificial\nintelligence (AI), a topic of increasing importance within EU policy\ndiscussions. The EU has recently issued several publications emphasizing the\nnecessity of trust in AI, underscoring the dual nature of AI as both a\nbeneficial tool and a potential weapon. This dichotomy highlights the urgent\nneed for international regulation. Concurrently, there is a need for frameworks\nthat guide companies in AI development, ensuring compliance with such\nregulations. Our research aims to assist lawmakers and machine learning\npractitioners in navigating the evolving landscape of AI regulation,\nidentifying focal areas for future attention. This paper introduces a\ncomprehensive and, to our knowledge, the first unified definition of\nresponsible AI. Through a structured literature review, we elucidate the\ncurrent understanding of responsible AI. Drawing from this analysis, we propose\nan approach for developing a future framework centered around this concept. Our\nfindings advocate for a human-centric approach to Responsible AI. This approach\nencompasses the implementation of AI methods with a strong emphasis on ethics,\nmodel explainability, and the pillars of privacy, security, and trust.",

Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable\nof advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more\nobjective diagnosis. Although the term `AI' is commonly used, recent success in\nits applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of\nmachine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and\npredict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been\nharnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for\nconsistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity.

Thus, we must take action to promote diversity among those in this\nfield. A critical step in this work is understanding why some students who\nchoose to study ML/AI later leave the field. While the persistence of diverse\npopulations has been studied in engineering, there is a lack of research\ninvestigating factors that influence persistence in ML/AI. In this work, we\npresent the advancement of a model of intentional persistence in ML/AI by\nsurveying students in ML/AI courses. We examine persistence across demographic\ngroups, such as gender, international student status, student loan status, and\nvisible minority status. We investigate independent variables that distinguish\nML/AI from other STEM fields, such as the varying emphasis on non-technical\nskills, the ambiguous ethical implications of the work, and the highly\ncompetitive and lucrative nature of the field. Our findings suggest that\nshort-term intentional persistence is associated with academic enrollment\nfactors such as major and level of study. Long-term intentional persistence is\ncorrelated with measures of professional role confidence. Unique to our study,\nwe show that wanting your work to have a positive social benefit is a negative\npredictor of long-term intentional persistence, and women generally care more\nabout this.

However, training an AI model on\nsensitive data raises concerns about the privacy of individual participants.\nFor example, summary statistics of a genome-wide association study can be used\nto determine the presence or absence of an individual in a given dataset. This\nconsiderable privacy risk has led to restrictions in accessing genomic and\nother biomedical data, which is detrimental for collaborative research and\nimpedes scientific progress. Hence, there has been a substantial effort to\ndevelop AI methods that can learn from sensitive data while protecting\nindividuals' privacy. This paper provides a structured overview of recent\nadvances in privacy-preserving AI techniques in biomedicine. It places the most\nimportant state-of-the-art approaches within a unified taxonomy and discusses\ntheir strengths, limitations, and open problems. As the most promising\ndirection, we suggest combining federated machine learning as a more scalable\napproach with other additional privacy preserving techniques. This would allow\nto merge the advantages to provide privacy guarantees in a distributed way for\nbiomedical applications. Nonetheless, more research is necessary as hybrid\napproaches pose new challenges such as additional network or computation\noverhead.",

However, common reliance on high-throughput ab initio data necessarily\ninherits limitations of such data: mismatch with experiments. On the other\nhand, experimental decisions are often guided by an expert's intuition honed\nfrom experiences that are rarely articulated. We propose using machine learning\nto \"bottle\" such operational intuition into quantifiable descriptors using\nexpertly curated measurement-based data. We introduce \"Materials\nExpert-Artificial Intelligence\" (ME-AI) to encapsulate and articulate this\nhuman intuition. As a first step towards such a program, we focus on the\ntopological semimetal (TSM) among square-net materials as the property inspired\nby the expert-identified descriptor based on structural information: the\ntolerance factor. We start by curating a dataset encompassing 12 primary\nfeatures of 879 square-net materials, using experimental data whenever\npossible. We then use Dirichlet-based Gaussian process regression using a\nspecialized kernel to reveal composite descriptors for square-net topological\nsemimetals. The ME-AI learned descriptors independently reproduce expert\nintuition and expand upon it. Specifically, new descriptors point to\nhypervalency as a critical chemical feature predicting TSM within square-net\ncompounds. Our success with a carefully defined problem points to the \"machine\nbottling human insight\" approach as promising for machine learning-aided\nmaterial discovery.",

While their fluency\nacross a variety of domains is impressive, modern AI systems fall short on\ntests requiring symbolic processing and abstraction - a glaring limitation\ngiven the necessity for interpretable and reliable technology. Despite a surge\nof reasoning benchmarks emerging from the academic community, no comprehensive\nand theoretically-motivated framework exists to quantify reasoning (and more\ngenerally, symbolic ability) in AI systems. Here, we adopt a framework from\ncomputational complexity theory to explicitly quantify symbolic generalization:\nalgebraic circuit complexity. Many symbolic reasoning problems can be recast as\nalgebraic expressions. Thus, algebraic circuit complexity theory - the study of\nalgebraic expressions as circuit models (i.e., directed acyclic graphs) - is a\nnatural framework to study the complexity of symbolic computation. The tools of\nalgebraic circuit complexity enable the study of generalization by defining\nbenchmarks in terms of their complexity-theoretic properties (i.e., the\ndifficulty of a problem). Moreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical\nobjects; for a given algebraic circuit, an arbitrarily large number of samples\ncan be generated for a specific circuit, making it an optimal testbed for the\ndata-hungry machine learning algorithms that are used today. Here, we adopt\ntools from algebraic circuit complexity theory, apply it to formalize a science\nof symbolic generalization, and address key theoretical and empirical\nchallenges for its successful application to AI science and its impact on the\nbroader community.",

O-RAN seeks to supplant\nhardware-specific Radio Access Network (RAN) components (e.g., the mobility\nmanagement entity (MME) or base station (gNB)) with generic hardware,\nspecialized software, and open signaling interfaces. The virtualization and\nnetwork slicing features of 5G allow for software to replace previously\nhardware specific functions. Software further provides faster analytics, thus\nsupporting 5Gs latency requirements and advanced usage scenarios (i.e.,\nenhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC),\nand ultra-reliable low latency communications (uRLLC)). Furthermore, as\nsoftware annexes control of the RAN, there is freedom to integrate Artificial\nIntelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms into RAN management\n(particularly at the user plane). This integration is one of the goals of\nO-RAN. Lastly, relying on generic hardware and specialized, open-source\nsoftware eliminates reliance upon specific device manufacturers.

While recent efforts on explainable AI\n(XAI) has received significant attention, most of the existing solutions are\nnot applicable in real-time systems since they map interpretability as an\noptimization problem, which leads to numerous iterations of time-consuming\ncomplex computations. Although there are existing hardware-based acceleration\nframework for XAI, they are implemented through FPGA and designed for specific\ntasks, leading to expensive cost and lack of flexibility. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet efficient framework to accelerate various XAI algorithms\nwith existing hardware accelerators. Specifically, this paper makes three\nimportant contributions. (1) The proposed method is the first attempt in\nexploring the effectiveness of Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) to accelerate XAI.\n(2) Our proposed solution explores the close relationship between several\nexisting XAI algorithms with matrix computations, and exploits the synergy\nbetween convolution and Fourier transform, which takes full advantage of TPU's\ninherent ability in accelerating matrix computations. (3) Our proposed approach\ncan lead to real-time outcome interpretation.

      "abstract": "In order to construct an ethical artificial intelligence (AI) two complex\nproblems must be overcome. Firstly, humans do not consistently agree on what is\nor is not ethical. Second, contemporary AI and machine learning methods tend to\nbe blunt instruments which either search for solutions within the bounds of\npredefined rules, or mimic behaviour. An ethical AI must be capable of\ninferring unspoken rules, interpreting nuance and context, possess and be able\nto infer intent, and explain not just its actions but its intent. Using\nenactivism, semiotics, perceptual symbol systems and symbol emergence, we\nspecify an agent that learns not just arbitrary relations between signs but\ntheir meaning in terms of the perceptual states of its sensorimotor system.\nSubsequently it can learn what is meant by a sentence and infer the intent of\nothers in terms of its own experiences. It has malleable intent because the\nmeaning of symbols changes as it learns, and its intent is represented\nsymbolically as a goal. As such it may learn a concept of what is most likely\nto be considered ethical by the majority within a population of humans, which\nmay then be used as a goal. The meaning of abstract symbols is expressed using\nperceptual symbols of raw sensorimotor stimuli as the weakest (consistent with\nOckham's Razor) necessary and sufficient concept, an intensional definition\nlearned from an ostensive definition, from which the extensional definition or\ncategory of all ethical decisions may be obtained. Because these abstract\nsymbols are the same for both situation and response, the same symbol is used\nwhen either performing or observing an action. This is akin to mirror neurons\nin the human brain. Mirror symbols may allow the agent to empathise, because\nits own experiences are associated with the symbol, which is also associated\nwith the observation of another agent experiencing something that symbol\nrepresents.",

A growing number of scholars from cartography\nhave demonstrated successfully that GeoAI can accelerate previously complex\ncartographic design tasks and even enable cartographic creativity in new ways.\nDespite the promise of GeoAI, researchers and practitioners have growing\nconcerns about the ethical issues of GeoAI for cartography. In this paper, we\nconducted a systematic content analysis and narrative synthesis of research\nstudies integrating GeoAI and cartography to summarize current research and\ndevelopment trends regarding the usage of GeoAI for cartographic design. Based\non this review and synthesis, we first identify dimensions of GeoAI methods for\ncartography such as data sources, data formats, map evaluations, and six\ncontemporary GeoAI models, each of which serves a variety of cartographic\ntasks. These models include decision trees, knowledge graph and semantic web\ntechnologies, deep convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial\nnetworks, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Further, we\nsummarize seven cartographic design applications where GeoAI have been\neffectively employed: generalization, symbolization, typography, map reading,\nmap interpretation, map analysis, and map production. We also raise five\npotential ethical challenges that need to be addressed in the integration of\nGeoAI for cartography: commodification, responsibility, privacy, bias, and\n(together) transparency, explainability, and provenance. We conclude by\nidentifying four potential research directions for future cartographic research\nwith GeoAI: GeoAI-enabled active cartographic symbolism, human-in-the-loop\nGeoAI for cartography, GeoAI-based mapping-as-a-service, and generative GeoAI\nfor cartography.",

In\nparticular, the Deep Learning paradigm enables the development of data analysis\ntools that support subject matter experts in a variety of sectors, from physics\nup to the recognition of ancient languages.

This study explores the capability of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), a particular class of Deep Learning algorithms specifically\ncrafted for computer vision tasks, to classify images of isolated fossil shark\nteeth gathered from online datasets as well as from the authors$'$ experience\non Peruvian Miocene and Italian Pliocene fossil assemblages.

We\ndeveloped a CNN, named SharkNet-X, specifically tailored on our recognition\ntask, reaching a 5-fold cross validated mean accuracy of 0.85 to identify\nimages containing a single shark tooth. Furthermore, we elaborated a\nvisualization of the features extracted from images using the last dense layer\nof the CNN, achieved through the application of the clustering technique t-SNE.\nIn addition, in order to understand and explain the behaviour of the CNN while\ngiving a paleontological point of view on the results, we introduced the\nexplainability method SHAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ninstance in which this method is applied to the field of palaeontology.

ASD is also associated with\ncommunication deficits and repetitive behavior in affected individuals. Various\nASD detection methods have been developed, including neuroimaging modalities\nand psychological tests. Among these methods, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nimaging modalities are of paramount importance to physicians. Clinicians rely\non MRI modalities to diagnose ASD accurately. The MRI modalities are\nnon-invasive methods that include functional (fMRI) and structural (sMRI)\nneuroimaging methods. However, diagnosing ASD with fMRI and sMRI for\nspecialists is often laborious and time-consuming; therefore, several\ncomputer-aided design systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) have\nbeen developed to assist specialist physicians. Conventional machine learning\n(ML) and deep learning (DL) are the most popular schemes of AI used for\ndiagnosing ASD. This study aims to review the automated detection of ASD using\nAI. We review several CADS that have been developed using ML techniques for the\nautomated diagnosis of ASD using MRI modalities. There has been very limited\nwork on the use of DL techniques to develop automated diagnostic models for\nASD. A summary of the studies developed using DL is provided in the\nSupplementary Appendix.

This might cause problems such as\noverwhelming tertiary facilities with mild condition patients, thus limiting\ntheir capacity of treating acute and critical patients. To address such\nmaldistributed patient volume, it is essential to oversee patients choices\nbefore further evaluation of a policy or resource allocation. This study used\nnationwide insurance data, accumulated possible features discussed in existing\nliterature, and used a deep neural network to predict the patients choices of\nhospital levels. This study also used explainable artificial intelligence\nmethods to interpret the contribution of features for the general public and\nindividuals. In addition, we explored the effectiveness of changing data\nrepresentations. The results showed that the model was able to predict with\nhigh area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) (0.90),\naccuracy (0.90), sensitivity (0.94), and specificity (0.97) with highly\nimbalanced label. Generally, social approval of the provider by the general\npublic (positive or negative) and the number of practicing physicians serving\nper ten thousand people of the located area are listed as the top effecting\nfeatures. The changing data representation had a positive effect on the\nprediction improvement. Deep learning methods can process highly imbalanced\ndata and achieve high accuracy. The effecting features affect the general\npublic and individuals differently. Addressing the sparsity and discrete nature\nof insurance data leads to better prediction. Applications using deep learning\ntechnology are promising in health policy making. More work is required to\ninterpret models and practice implementation.",

      "abstract": "Evaluation has always been a key challenge in the development of artificial\nintelligence (AI) based software, due to the technical complexity of the\nsoftware artifact and, often, its embedding in complex sociotechnical\nprocesses. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) enabled by deep neural\nnetworks has exacerbated the challenge of evaluating such software due to the\nopaque nature of these ML-based artifacts. A key related issue is the\n(in)ability of such systems to generate useful explanations of their outputs,\nand we argue that the explanation and evaluation problems are closely linked.\nThe paper models the elements of a ML-based AI system in the context of public\nsector decision (PSD) applications involving both artificial and human\nintelligence, and maps these elements against issues in both evaluation and\nexplanation, showing how the two are related. We consider a number of common\nPSD application patterns in the light of our model, and identify a set of key\nissues connected to explanation and evaluation in each case. Finally, we\npropose multiple strategies to promote wider adoption of AI/ML technologies in\nPSD, where each is distinguished by a focus on different elements of our model,\nallowing PSD policy makers to adopt an approach that best fits their context\nand concerns.",

Neuronal\nbehavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography\n(EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and\nhuman-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while\nevaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data.\nSpikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a\nconsequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements.\nHence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike\nclassification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes\nmanually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves\nextensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced\ninto neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This\nreview discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing\non the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three\nmain components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing\nmethods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also\nhighlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to\nprovide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The\nreview organizes materials in the spike classification field for future\nstudies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different\ndatabases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose\npapers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine\nlearning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were\nselected.",

Currently,\nthere is no accurate automated system to predict such events to assist with\nclinical decision-making. To fill this gap, we propose \"Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) for Modeling and Explaining Neonatal Health\" (AIMEN), a deep learning\nframework that not only predicts adverse labor outcomes from maternal, fetal,\nobstetrical, and intrapartum risk factors but also provides the model's\nreasoning behind the predictions made.

We address the challenges of imbalance and small datasets by\nsynthesizing additional training data using Adaptive Synthetic Sampling\n(ADASYN) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN). AIMEN\nuses an ensemble of fully-connected neural networks as the backbone for its\nclassification with the data augmentation supported by either ADASYN or CTGAN.\nAIMEN, supported by CTGAN, outperforms AIMEN supported by ADASYN in\nclassification. AIMEN can predict a high risk for adverse labor outcomes with\nan average F1 score of 0.784.

We followed the PRISMA-ScR\nguidelines. We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve\nrelevant studies. We extracted data from 34 studies that fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria. In our analysis, a typical workflow was observed: feeding\nraw data, fusing different data modalities by applying conventional machine\nlearning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms, and finally, evaluating the\nmultimodal fusion through clinical outcome predictions. Specifically, early\nfusion was the most used technique in most applications for multimodal learning\n(22 out of 34 studies). We found that multimodality fusion models outperformed\ntraditional single-modality models for the same task.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical\ntasks often exhibit bias in the form of disparities in performance between\nsubgroups. Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data\nare easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those\nbiases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at\nameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel\nanalysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact\nof biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this\nframework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical\nimaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with\nknown disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by\nusing three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated\nbias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the\nefficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the\nsimulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the\nCNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified\nas the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we\ndemonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the\nmanifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI\nmodels is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of\nbiases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a\nnovel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation\nstrategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of\nclinical AI that is robust and responsible.",

An extensive analysis of transfer learning techniques for image\nclassification using benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures\nsuch as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, etc. is carried out. On top\nof this classification model, a post-hoc XAI technique, viz. Local\nInterpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are incorporated to provide\ntransparent justifications for the model's decisions by perturbing input data\nlocally to see how predictions change. Furthermore, Submodular Picks LIME\n(SP-LIME) a version of LIME particular to images, that perturbs the image based\non the submodular picks is also extensively studied. To this end, two\nsubmodular optimization algorithms i.e. Quickshift and Simple Linear Iterative\nClustering (SLIC) are leveraged towards submodular picks. The extensive\nanalysis of XAI techniques highlights interpretability of the results in a more\nhuman-compliant way, thus boosting our confidence and reliability.",

      "abstract": "Hot subdwarfs are compact blue evolved objects, burning helium in their cores\nsurrounded by a tiny hydrogen envelope. Most models agree on a common envelope\nbinary evolution scenario in the Red Giant phase. However, the binarity rate\nfor these objects is yet unsolved. We aim to develop a novel classification\nmethod for identifying hot subdwarf binaries within large datasets using\nArtificial Intelligence methods and Gaia DR3 data. The results will be compared\nwith those obtained previously using VOSA (Virtual Observatory Sed Analyzer) on\ncoincident samples. The methods include several machine learning techniques. We\nused Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify 3084 hot subdwarf stars based on\ntheir color-magnitude properties. Of these, 2815 objects have Gaia Data Release\n3 BP/RP spectra, which were classified using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The findings demonstrate a high agreement\nlevel (70-90%) with VOSA's classification, indicating that machine learning\nmethods effectively classify sources with an accuracy comparable to human\ninspection or non-AI techniques. SVM in a radial basis function achieves 70.97%\nreproducibility for binary targets using photometry. CNN reaches 84.94% for\nbinary detection using spectroscopy. We also found that the single-binary\ndifferences are especially observable on the infrared flux in our GDR3 BP/BR\nspectra, at wavelengths larger than 700 nm. We found that all our methods are\neffective in discerning between single and binary systems and are consistent\nwith the results previously obtained with VOSA. In global terms, considering\nall quality metrics, CNN is the method that provides the best accuracy. The\nmethods are also effective for detecting peculiarities in the spectra. Further\nresearch is needed to refine our techniques and enhance automated\nclassification reliability, especially for large-scale surveys.",

Self organized machine learning has been highly\nsuccessful in the analysis of visual data the human expert eye may not be able\nto see. Thus, subtle but significant changes in fine visual detail in images\nrelating to trending alterations in natural or urban landscapes may remain\nundetected. In the course of time, such changes may be the cause or the\nconsequence of measurable human impact. Capturing such change in imaging data\nas early as possible can make critical information readily available to\ncitizens, professionals and policymakers. This promotes change awareness, and\nfacilitates early decision making for action. Here, we use unsupervised\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) that exploits principles of self-organized\nbiological visual learning for the analysis of imaging time series. The\nquantization error in the output of a Self Organizing Map prototype is\nexploited as a computational metric of variability and change. Given the proven\nsensitivity of this neural network metric to the intensity and polarity of\nimage pixel colour, it is shown to capture critical changes in urban\nlandscapes. This is achieved here on imaging data for two regions of geographic\ninterest in Las Vegas County, Nevada, USA. The SOM analysis is combined with\nthe statistical analysis of demographic data revealing human impacts. These\nlatter are significantly correlated with the structural change trends in the\nnumerical data for the specific regions of interest. By correlating data\nrelative to the impact of human activities with numerical data indicating\nstructural evolution, human footprint related environmental changes can be\npredictably scaled.",

The system we built using this method is called the Appendable Memory\nsystem. The Appendable Memory system enables an artificial intelligence (AI) to\nacquire new knowledge even after deployment. It consists of two AIs: the\nMemorizer and the Recaller. This system is a key-value store built using neural\nnetworks. The Memorizer receives data and stores it in the Appendable Memory\nvector, which is dynamically updated when the AI acquires new knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the Recaller retrieves information from the Appendable Memory\nvector. What we want to teach AI in this study are the operations of memorizing\nand recalling information. However, traditional machine learning methods make\nAI learn features inherent in the learning dataset. We demonstrate that the\nsystems we intend to create cannot be realized by current machine learning\nmethods, that is, by merely repeating the input and output learning sequences\nwith AI. Instead, we propose a method to teach AI to learn operations, by\ncompletely removing the features contained in the learning dataset.\nSpecifically, we probabilized all the data involved in learning. This measure\nprevented AI from learning the features of the data.

      "abstract": "Thanks to rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent\nyears, the current artificial intelligence technology is contributing to many\npart of society. Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism,\neconomy, politics, etc. are having a very large impact on society as a whole.\nFor example, in the field of education, there is an artificial intelligence\ntutoring system that automatically assigns tutors based on student's level. In\nthe field of economics, there are quantitative investment methods that\nautomatically analyze large amounts of data to find investment laws to create\ninvestment models or predict changes in financial markets. As such, artificial\nintelligence technology is being used in various fields. So, it is very\nimportant to know exactly what factors have an important influence on each\nfield of artificial intelligence technology and how the relationship between\neach field is connected. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze artificial\nintelligence technology in each field. In this paper, we analyze patent\ndocuments related to artificial intelligence technology. We propose a method\nfor keyword analysis within factors using artificial intelligence patent data\nsets for artificial intelligence technology analysis. This is a model that\nrelies on feature engineering based on deep learning model named KeyBERT, and\nusing vector space model. A case study of collecting and analyzing artificial\nintelligence patent data was conducted to show how the proposed model can be\napplied to real world problems.",

We introduce the Self-Enhancing Multi-Photon Artificial\nIntelligence (SEMPAI), that integrates hypothesis-driven priors in a\ndata-driven DL approach for research on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of muscle\nfibers. SEMPAI utilizes meta-learning to optimize prior integration, data\nrepresentation, and neural network architecture simultaneously. This allows\nhypothesis testing and provides interpretable feedback about the origin of\nbiological information in MPM images. SEMPAI performs joint learning of several\ntasks to enable prediction for small datasets. The method is applied on an\nextensive multi-study dataset resulting in the largest joint analysis of\npathologies and function for single muscle fibers. SEMPAI outperforms\nstate-of-the-art biomarkers in six of seven predictive tasks, including those\nwith scarce data. SEMPAI's DL models with integrated priors are superior to\nthose without priors and to prior-only machine learning approaches.",

However, to achieve optimum\nresults it is important to select wisely the Transmission mode of the D2D\nDevice to form clusters in the most fruitful positions in terms of Sum Rate and\nPower Consumption. Towards this end, this paper investigates the use of\nDistributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and innovative to D2D, Machine\nLearning (ML) approaches to achieve satisfactory results in terms of Spectral\nEfficiency (SE), Power Consumption (PC) and execution time, with the creation\nof clusters and backhauling D2D network under existing Base Station/Small Cell.\nAdditionally, one of the major factors that affect the creation of high-quality\nclusters under a D2D network is the number of the Devices. Therefore, this\npaper focuses on a small (<=200) number of Devices, with the purpose to\nidentify the limits of each approach in terms of number of devices.\nSpecifically, to identify where it is beneficial to form a cluster, investigate\nthe critical point that gains increases rapidly and at the end examine the\napplicability of 5G requirements. Additionally, prior work presented a\nDistributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) Solution/Framework in D2D and a DAIS\nTransmission Mode Selection (TMS) plan was proposed. In this paper DAIS is\nfurther examined, improved in terms of thresholds evaluation, evaluated, and\ncompared with other approaches (AI/ML). The results obtained demonstrate the\nexceptional performance of DAIS, compared to all other related approaches in\nterms of SE, PC, execution time and cluster formation efficiency.

Using artificial intelligence to predict adverse drug\nreactions in real time could revolutionize oncology treatment. This study aims\nto assess the performance of artificial intelligence models in predicting\nadverse drug reactions in patients with cancer. This is the first systematic\nreview and meta-analysis. Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library\ndatabases were searched for studies in English, French, and Arabic from January\n1, 2018, to August 20, 2023. The inclusion criteria were: (1) peer-reviewed\nresearch articles; (2) use of artificial intelligence algorithms (machine\nlearning, deep learning, knowledge graphs); (3) study aimed to predict adverse\ndrug reactions (cardiotoxicity, neutropenia, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity);\n(4) study was on cancer patients. The data were extracted and evaluated by\nthree reviewers for study quality. Of the 332 screened articles, 17 studies\n(5%) involving 93,248 oncology patients from 17 countries were included in the\nsystematic review, of which ten studies synthesized the meta-analysis. A\nrandom-effects model was created to pool the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC\nof the included studies. The pooled results were 0.82 (95% CI:0.69, 0.9), 0.84\n(95% CI:0.75, 0.9), and 0.83 (95% CI:0.77, 0.87) for sensitivity, specificity,\nand AUC, respectively, of ADR predictive models. Biomarkers proved their\neffectiveness in predicting ADRs, yet they were adopted by only half of the\nreviewed studies. The use of AI in cancer treatment shows great potential, with\nmodels demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity in predicting ADRs.\nHowever, standardized research and multicenter studies are needed to improve\nthe quality of evidence.

      "abstract": "In the realm of digital media, the advent of AI-generated synthetic images\nhas introduced significant challenges in distinguishing between real and\nfabricated visual content. These images, often indistinguishable from authentic\nones, pose a threat to the credibility of digital media, with potential\nimplications for disinformation and fraud. Our research addresses this\nchallenge by employing machine learning techniques to discern between\nAI-generated and genuine images. Central to our approach is the CIFAKE dataset,\na comprehensive collection of images labeled as \"Real\" and \"Fake\". We refine\nand adapt advanced deep learning architectures like ResNet, VGGNet, and\nDenseNet, utilizing transfer learning to enhance their precision in identifying\nsynthetic images. We also compare these with a baseline model comprising a\nvanilla Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a custom Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN). The experimental results were significant, demonstrating that our\noptimized deep learning models outperform traditional methods, with DenseNet\nachieving an accuracy of 97.74%. Our application study contributes by applying\nand optimizing these advanced models for synthetic image detection, conducting\na comparative analysis using various metrics, and demonstrating their superior\ncapability in identifying AI-generated images over traditional machine learning\ntechniques. This research not only advances the field of digital media\nintegrity but also sets a foundation for future explorations into the ethical\nand technical dimensions of AI-generated content in digital media.",

This is\ndriven by the easier access to sensory data and the enormous scale of\npervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes (ZB) of real-time data\nstreams. Designing accurate models using such data streams, to predict future\ninsights and revolutionize the decision-taking process, inaugurates pervasive\nsystems as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life. The confluence of\npervasive computing and artificial intelligence, Pervasive AI, expanded the\nrole of ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing\ndistributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized learning,\npresenting various challenges. In this context, a wise cooperation and resource\nscheduling should be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, smart\nvehicles) and infrastructure (e.g. edge nodes, and base stations) to avoid\ncommunication and computation overheads and ensure maximum performance. In this\npaper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent techniques developed to\novercome these resource challenges in pervasive AI systems. Specifically, we\nfirst present an overview of the pervasive computing, its architecture, and its\nintersection with artificial intelligence. We then review the background,\napplications and performance metrics of AI, particularly Deep Learning (DL) and\nonline learning, running in a ubiquitous system. Next, we provide a deep\nliterature review of communication-efficient techniques, from both algorithmic\nand system perspectives, of distributed inference, training and online learning\ntasks across the combination of IoT devices, edge devices and cloud servers.\nFinally, we discuss our future vision and research challenges.",

The battle with the novel Coronavirus is baffling and\nhorrifying after the Spanish Flu 2019. While the front-line doctors and medical\nresearchers have made significant progress in controlling the spread of the\nhighly contiguous virus, technology has also proved its significance in the\nbattle. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence has been adopted in many medical\napplications to diagnose many diseases, even baffling experienced doctors.\nTherefore, this survey paper explores the methodologies proposed that can aid\ndoctors and researchers in early and inexpensive methods of diagnosis of the\ndisease. Most developing countries have difficulties carrying out tests using\nthe conventional manner, but a significant way can be adopted with Machine and\nDeep Learning. On the other hand, the access to different types of medical\nimages has motivated the researchers. As a result, a mammoth number of\ntechniques are proposed. This paper first details the background knowledge of\nthe conventional methods in the Artificial Intelligence domain. Following that,\nwe gather the commonly used datasets and their use cases to date. In addition,\nwe also show the percentage of researchers adopting Machine Learning over Deep\nLearning. Thus we provide a thorough analysis of this scenario. Lastly, in the\nresearch challenges, we elaborate on the problems faced in COVID-19 research,\nand we address the issues with our understanding to build a bright and healthy\nenvironment.",

In this approach, a deep\n(multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained in a supervised manner\nusing backpropagation. Huge amounts of labeled examples are required, but the\nresulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming\nhumans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static,\ncontinuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to\ncompute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike\nrates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically\nrealistic than ANNs, and arguably the only viable option if one wants to\nunderstand how the brain computes. SNNs are also more hardware friendly and\nenergy-efficient than ANNs, and are thus appealing for technology, especially\nfor portable devices. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking\nneurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using\nbackpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to\ntrain deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy, but also computational\ncost and hardware friendliness. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag\nbehind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even\nvanish on some tasks, while the SNNs typically require much fewer operations.",

      "abstract": "Perhaps the most ambitious scientific quest in human history is the creation\nof general artificial intelligence, which roughly means AI that is as smart or\nsmarter than humans. The dominant approach in the machine learning community is\nto attempt to discover each of the pieces required for intelligence, with the\nimplicit assumption that some future group will complete the Herculean task of\nfiguring out how to combine all of those pieces into a complex thinking\nmachine. I call this the \"manual AI approach\". This paper describes another\nexciting path that ultimately may be more successful at producing general AI.\nIt is based on the clear trend in machine learning that hand-designed solutions\neventually are replaced by more effective, learned solutions. The idea is to\ncreate an AI-generating algorithm (AI-GA), which automatically learns how to\nproduce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for the approach: (1)\nmeta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms\nthemselves, and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that\neither approach could produce general AI first, and both are scientifically\nworthwhile irrespective of which is the fastest path. Because both are\npromising, yet the ML community is currently committed to the manual approach,\nI argue that our community should increase its research investment in the AI-GA\napproach. To encourage such research, I describe promising work in each of the\nThree Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific safety and ethical considerations.\nBecause it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because it is\ninherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a\nsimple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian\nevolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs\nshould be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.",

With their exponential growth challenging existing electronic\nhardware, optical neural networks (ONNs) are emerging to process DNN tasks in\nthe optical domain with high clock rates, parallelism and low-loss data\ntransmission. However, to explore the potential of ONNs, it is necessary to\ninvestigate the full-system performance incorporating the major DNN elements,\nincluding matrix algebra and nonlinear activation. Existing challenges to ONNs\nare high energy consumption due to low electro-optic (EO) conversion\nefficiency, low compute density due to large device footprint and channel\ncrosstalk, and long latency due to the lack of inline nonlinearity. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate an ONN system that simultaneously overcomes all\nthese challenges. We exploit neuron encoding with volume-manufactured\nmicron-scale vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) transmitter arrays\nthat exhibit high EO conversion (<5 attojoule/symbol with $V_\\pi$=4 mV), high\noperation bandwidth (up to 25 GS/s), and compact footprint (<0.01 mm$^2$ per\ndevice). Photoelectric multiplication allows low-energy matrix operations at\nthe shot-noise quantum limit. Homodyne detection-based nonlinearity enables\nnonlinear activation with instantaneous response. The full-system energy\nefficiency and compute density reach 7 femtojoules per operation (fJ/OP) and 25\nTeraOP/(mm$^2\\cdot$ s), both representing a >100-fold improvement over\nstate-of-the-art digital computers, with substantially several more orders of\nmagnitude for future improvement.

Scientists have tested the power of intelligent\nalgorithms developed to predict (or learn from) natural, physical and social\nphenomena. This also applies to crime-related research problems. Nonetheless,\nstudies that map the current state of the art at the intersection between AI\nand crime are lacking. What are the current research trends in terms of topics\nin this area? What is the structure of scientific collaboration when\nconsidering works investigating criminal issues using machine learning, deep\nlearning, and AI in general? What are the most active countries in this\nspecific scientific sphere? Using data retrieved from the Scopus database, this\nwork quantitatively analyzes 692 published works at the intersection between AI\nand crime employing network science to respond to these questions. Results show\nthat researchers are mainly focusing on cyber-related criminal topics and that\nrelevant themes such as algorithmic discrimination, fairness, and ethics are\nconsiderably overlooked. Furthermore, data highlight the extremely disconnected\nstructure of co-authorship networks. Such disconnectedness may represent a\nsubstantial obstacle to a more solid community of scientists interested in\nthese topics. Additionally, the graph of scientific collaboration indicates\nthat countries that are more prone to engage in international partnerships are\ngenerally less central in the network. This means that scholars working in\nhighly productive countries (e.g. the United States, China) tend to mostly\ncollaborate domestically.

Uncontrolled active distribution systems\nexhibit wide variations of voltage and loading throughout the day as some of\nthese resources operate under max power tracking control of highly variable\nwind and solar irradiation while others exhibit random variations and/or\ndependency on weather conditions. It is necessary to control the system to\nprovide power reliably and securely under normal voltages and frequency.\nClassical optimization approaches to control the system towards this goal\nsuffer from the dimensionality of the problem and the need for a global\noptimization approach to coordinate a huge number of small resources.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) methods offer an alternative that can provide a\npractical approach to this problem.

Despite the growing use of Deep Learning (DL)\nnetworks, little is actually understood about the learning mechanisms and\nrepresentations that makes these networks effective across such a diverse range\nof applications. Part of the answer must be the huge scale of the architecture\nand of course the large scale of the data, since not much has changed since\n1987. But the nature of deep learned representations remain largely unknown.\nUnfortunately training sets with millions or billions of tokens have unknown\ncombinatorics and Networks with millions or billions of hidden units cannot\neasily be visualized and their mechanisms cannot be easily revealed. In this\npaper, we explore these questions with a large (1.24M weights; VGG) DL in a\nnovel high density sample task (5 unique tokens with at minimum 500 exemplars\nper token) which allows us to more carefully follow the emergence of category\nstructure and feature construction. We use various visualization methods for\nfollowing the emergence of the classification and the development of the\ncoupling of feature detectors and structures that provide a type of graphical\nbootstrapping, From these results we harvest some basic observations of the\nlearning dynamics of DL and propose a new theory of complex feature\nconstruction based on our results.",

They will interact with both other learning agents\nand humans in a variety of complex settings including social dilemmas. We argue\nthat there is a need for research on the intersection between game theory and\nartificial intelligence, with the goal of achieving cooperative artificial\nintelligence that can navigate social dilemmas well. We consider the problem of\nhow an external agent can promote cooperation between artificial learners by\ndistributing additional rewards and punishments based on observing the actions\nof the learners. We propose a rule for automatically learning how to create the\nright incentives by considering the anticipated parameter updates of each\nagent. Using this learning rule leads to cooperation with high social welfare\nin matrix games in which the agents would otherwise learn to defect with high\nprobability. We show that the resulting cooperative outcome is stable in\ncertain games even if the planning agent is turned off after a given number of\nepisodes, while other games require ongoing intervention to maintain mutual\ncooperation. Finally, we reflect on what the goals of multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning should be in the first place, and discuss the necessary building\nblocks towards the goal of building cooperative AI.",

It is argued that AI should use the Popperian\nscientific method in which it is the duty of scientists to attempt to falsify\ntheories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper\ndescribes the Popperian method and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the\nmethod to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior.\nIt is shown how Lighthill's falsifying arguments especially combinatorial\nexplosion continue to apply to modern AI. Various skeptical arguments against\nthe assumptions of AI mostly by physicists especially against Hilbert's\nphilosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal\nsentences. John von Neumann's arguments from natural complexity against neural\nnetworks and evolutionary algorithms are discussed. Next the game of chess is\ndiscussed to show how modern chess experts have reacted to computer chess\nprograms. It is shown that currently chess masters can defeat any chess program\nusing Kasperov's arguments from his 1997 Deep Blue match and aftermath.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise to improve healthcare\nover the next decades. Specifically, AI systems leveraging multiple data\nsources and input modalities are poised to become a viable method to deliver\nmore accurate results and deployable pipelines across a wide range of\napplications. In this work, we propose and evaluate a unified Holistic AI in\nMedicine (HAIM) framework to facilitate the generation and testing of AI\nsystems that leverage multimodal inputs. Our approach uses generalizable data\npre-processing and machine learning modeling stages that can be readily adapted\nfor research and deployment in healthcare environments. We evaluate our HAIM\nframework by training and characterizing 14,324 independent models based on\nHAIM-MIMIC-MM, a multimodal clinical database (N=34,537 samples) containing\n7,279 unique hospitalizations and 6,485 patients, spanning all possible input\ncombinations of 4 data modalities (i.e., tabular, time-series, text, and\nimages), 11 unique data sources and 12 predictive tasks. We show that this\nframework can consistently and robustly produce models that outperform similar\nsingle-source approaches across various healthcare demonstrations (by 6-33%),\nincluding 10 distinct chest pathology diagnoses, along with length-of-stay and\n48-hour mortality predictions. We also quantify the contribution of each\nmodality and data source using Shapley values, which demonstrates the\nheterogeneity in data modality importance and the necessity of multimodal\ninputs across different healthcare-relevant tasks. The generalizable properties\nand flexibility of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework could offer a\npromising pathway for future multimodal predictive systems in clinical and\noperational healthcare settings.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has re-energized\nresearch into general artificial intelligence. While the idea of\ndomain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to\nterms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure\nof the tasks humans perform. The position of this article is that only by\naligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we\nstand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI). A broad\nreading of the famous 'No Free Lunch' theorem is that there is no universally\noptimal inductive bias or, equivalently, bias-free learning is impossible. This\nfollows from the fact that there are an infinite number of ways to extrapolate\ndata, any of which might be the one used by the data generating environment; an\ninductive bias prefers some of these extrapolations to others, which lowers\nperformance in environments using these adversarial extrapolations. We may\nposit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of\nits environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this\nagent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative\nenvironments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment\nas being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is\nobviously irrelevant. But, we should expect a sharper inductive bias if we\nfurther constrain our environment. Indeed, we implicitly do so by defining GAI\nin terms of accomplishing that humans consider useful. One common version of\nthis is need the for 'common-sense reasoning', which implicitly appeals to the\nstatistics of physical universe as perceived by humans.",

Furthermore, translational goals of data\nsharing, validation of performance for regulatory approval, generalizability\nand mitigation of unintended bias must be accounted for early in the\ndevelopment process. In this perspective paper we explore challenges unique to\nhigh dimensional clinical imaging data, in addition to highlighting some of the\ntechnical and ethical considerations in developing high-dimensional,\nmulti-modality, machine learning systems for clinical decision support.",

Recently, Google's breakthrough shows great potential to improve\nthe accuracy of the existing error correction methods. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of advancements in the use of artificial intelligence (AI)\ntools to enhance QEC schemes for existing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum\n(NISQ) systems.

It is clear from the evidence, that these methods have recently shown\nsuperior efficiency and accuracy in the QEC pipeline compared to conventional\napproaches. Our review covers more than 150 relevant studies, offering a\ncomprehensive overview of progress and perspective in this field. We organized\nthe reviewed literature on the basis of the AI strategies employed and\nimprovements in error correction performance. We also discuss challenges ahead\nsuch as data sparsity caused by limited quantum error datasets and scalability\nissues as the number of quantum bits (qubits) in quantum systems kept\nincreasing very fast.

The population of\npatients who receive both an ECG and HbA1c may a biased sample of the complete\noutpatient population, so we adjusted the importance placed on each patient to\ngenerate a more representative pseudo-population. We found ECG-based assessment\noutperforms the ADA Risk test, achieving a higher area under the curve (0.80\nvs. 0.68) and positive predictive value (13% vs. 9%) -- 2.6 times the\nprevalence of diabetes in the cohort.

Previous work on characterizing the infiltrative\nheterogeneity in the peritumoral region used various imaging modalities, but\ninformation of extracellular free water movement restriction has been limitedly\nexplored. Here, we derive a unique set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based\nmarkers capturing the heterogeneity of tumor infiltration, by characterizing\nfree water movement restriction in the peritumoral region using Diffusion\nTensor Imaging (DTI)-based free water volume fraction maps. A novel voxel-wise\ndeep learning-based peritumoral microenvironment index (PMI) is first extracted\nby leveraging the widely different water diffusivity properties of\nglioblastomas and brain metastases as regions with and without infiltrations in\nthe peritumoral tissue. Descriptive characteristics of locoregional hubs of\nuniformly high PMI values are extracted as AI-based markers to capture distinct\naspects of infiltrative heterogeneity. The proposed markers are applied to two\nclinical use cases on an independent population of 275 adult-type diffuse\ngliomas (CNS WHO grade 4), analyzing the duration of survival among\nIsocitrate-Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-wildtypes and the differences with\nIDH1-mutants.

      "abstract": "Due to the ever-expanding volume of observed spectroscopic data from surveys\nsuch as SDSS and LAMOST, it has become important to apply artificial\nintelligence (AI) techniques for analysing stellar spectra to solve spectral\nclassification and regression problems like the determination of stellar\natmospheric parameters Teff, log g, [Fe/H]. We propose an automated approach\nfor the classification of stellar spectra in the optical region using\nConvolutional Neural Networks. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods with\n\"shallow\" architecture (usually up to 2 hidden layers) have been trained for\nthese purposes in the past. However, deep learning methods with a larger number\nof hidden layers allow the use of finer details in the spectrum which results\nin improved accuracy and better generalisation. Studying finer spectral\nsignatures also enables us to determine accurate differential stellar\nparameters and find rare objects. We examine various machine and deep learning\nalgorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify stellar spectra using the Jacoby\nAtlas, ELODIE and MILES spectral libraries as training samples. We test the\nperformance of the trained networks on the Indo-U.S. Library of Coude Feed\nStellar Spectra (CFLIB). We show that using convolutional neural networks, we\nare able to lower the error up to 1.23 spectral sub-classes as compared to that\nof 2 sub-classes achieved in the past studies with ML approach. We further\napply the trained model to classify stellar spectra retrieved from the SDSS\ndatabase with SNR>20.",

From autonomous vehicles and banking to medical care, housing, and\nlegal decisions, there will soon be enormous amounts of algorithms that make\ndecisions with limited human interference.

Current XAI approaches\nassume the features in the models are independent and calculate the effect of\neach feature toward model prediction independently from the rest of the\nfeatures. However, such assumption is not realistic in real life applications.\nWe propose an Additive Effects of Collinearity (AEC) as a novel XAI method that\naim to considers the collinearity issue when it models the effect of each\nfeature in the model on the outcome. AEC is based on the idea of dividing\nmultivariate models into several univariate models in order to examine their\nimpact on each other and consequently on the outcome. The proposed method is\nimplemented using simulated and real data to validate its efficiency comparing\nwith the a state of arts XAI method. The results indicate that AEC is more\nrobust and stable against the impact of collinearity when it explains AI models\ncompared with the state of arts XAI method.",

Artificial intelligence\n(AI) methods may alleviate these problems by assisting pathologists to reduce\nworkload and harmonize grading.\n  Methods: We digitized 6,682 needle biopsies from 976 participants in the\npopulation based STHLM3 diagnostic study to train deep neural networks for\nassessing prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the\npresence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test\nset comprising 1,631 biopsies from 245 men. We additionally evaluated grading\nperformance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological\npathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We\nassessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics (ROC)\nand tumor extent predictions by correlating predicted millimeter cancer length\nagainst measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the\nconcordance between grades assigned by the AI and the expert urological\npathologists using Cohen's kappa.\n  Results: The performance of the AI to detect and grade cancer in prostate\nneedle biopsy samples was comparable to that of international experts in\nprostate pathology. The AI achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.997 for\ndistinguishing between benign and malignant biopsy cores, and 0.999 for\ndistinguishing between men with or without prostate cancer. The correlation\nbetween millimeter cancer predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting\npathologist was 0.96. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved an average\npairwise kappa of 0.62. This was within the range of the corresponding values\nfor the expert pathologists (0.60 to 0.73).",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the geoscience community with\ndeep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within\nworkflows. This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation\nmodels (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or\nreplace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks,\neven for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the\ninevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation\nframework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and\nfuture FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping\ntraining-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously\nconstruct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods\ntailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate\nperformance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random\ndata sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations\nof model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular\nseismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show\nhow the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to\nbiased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model\nfor their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing\nmodel performance at varying budgets of training data.",

Although some new technologies i.e.\nrobotic techniques that are currently in practice can collect objective,\nquantified data, the inspectors own expertise is still critical in many\ninstances since these technologies are not designed to work interactively with\nhuman inspector. This study aims to create a smart, human centered method that\noffers significant contributions to infrastructure inspection, maintenance,\nmanagement practice, and safety for the bridge owners. By developing a smart\nMixed Reality framework, which can be integrated into a wearable holographic\nheadset device, a bridge inspector, for example, can automatically analyze a\ncertain defect such as a crack that he or she sees on an element, display its\ndimension information in real-time along with the condition state. Such systems\ncan potentially decrease the time and cost of infrastructure inspections by\naccelerating essential tasks of the inspector such as defect measurement,\ncondition assessment and data processing to management systems. The human\ncentered artificial intelligence will help the inspector collect more\nquantified and objective data while incorporating inspectors professional\njudgement. This study explains in detail the described system and related\nmethodologies of implementing attention guided semi supervised deep learning\ninto mixed reality technology, which interacts with the human inspector during\nassessment.

The discussion begins with a detailed\ndefinition of robustness, portraying it as the ability of ML models to maintain\nstable performance across varied and unexpected environmental conditions. ML\nrobustness is dissected through several lenses: its complementarity with\ngeneralizability; its status as a requirement for trustworthy AI; its\nadversarial vs non-adversarial aspects; its quantitative metrics; and its\nindicators such as reproducibility and explainability. The chapter delves into\nthe factors that impede robustness, such as data bias, model complexity, and\nthe pitfalls of underspecified ML pipelines. It surveys key techniques for\nrobustness assessment from a broad perspective, including adversarial attacks,\nencompassing both digital and physical realms. It covers non-adversarial data\nshifts and nuances of Deep Learning (DL) software testing methodologies. The\ndiscussion progresses to explore amelioration strategies for bolstering\nrobustness, starting with data-centric approaches like debiasing and\naugmentation. Further examination includes a variety of model-centric methods\nsuch as transfer learning, adversarial training, and randomized smoothing.\nLastly, post-training methods are discussed, including ensemble techniques,\npruning, and model repairs, emerging as cost-effective strategies to make\nmodels more resilient against the unpredictable. This chapter underscores the\nongoing challenges and limitations in estimating and achieving ML robustness by\nexisting approaches. It offers insights and directions for future research on\nthis crucial concept, as a prerequisite for trustworthy AI systems.",

Today, AI has started to advance natural\nsciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural\nphenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new\narea of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging\nresearch paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly\ninterdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field\nis needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough\naccount of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and\ncontinuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the\nsubatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,\nmaterials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales\nand form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on\nthese areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby\nallowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to\ncapture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by\ndeep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of\ntechniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss\nother common technical challenges, including explainability,\nout-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and\nlarge language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning\nand education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be\nuseful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may\ntrigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.",

For this, we introduce an algorithm to\nperform a quantum convolution product on images, as well as a new way to\nperform a fast tomography on quantum states. We prove that these quantum\nalgorithms are faster versions of equivalent classical algorithms, but exhibit\nrandom effects due to the quantum nature of the computation. Many simulations\nhave been carried out to study these effects and measure their learning\naccuracy on real data. Finally, we will present a quantum orthogonal neural\nnetwork circuit adapted to the currently available small and imperfect quantum\ncomputers. This allows us to perform real experiments to test our theory.",

      "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification and robustness to distribution shifts are\nimportant goals in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Although\nBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) allow for uncertainty in the predictions to be\nassessed, different sources of predictive uncertainty cannot be distinguished\nproperly. We present Credal Bayesian Deep Learning (CBDL). Heuristically, CBDL\nallows to train an (uncountably) infinite ensemble of BNNs, using only finitely\nmany elements. This is possible thanks to prior and likelihood finitely\ngenerated credal sets (FGCSs), a concept from the imprecise probability\nliterature. Intuitively, convex combinations of a finite collection of\nprior-likelihood pairs are able to represent infinitely many such pairs. After\ntraining, CBDL outputs a set of posteriors on the parameters of the neural\nnetwork. At inference time, such posterior set is used to derive a set of\npredictive distributions that is in turn utilized to distinguish between\n(predictive) aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and to quantify them. The\npredictive set also produces either (i) a collection of outputs enjoying\ndesirable probabilistic guarantees, or (ii) the single output that is deemed\nthe best, that is, the one having the highest predictive lower probability --\nanother imprecise-probabilistic concept. CBDL is more robust than single BNNs\nto prior and likelihood misspecification, and to distribution shift. We show\nthat CBDL is better at quantifying and disentangling different types of\n(predictive) uncertainties than single BNNs and ensemble of BNNs. In addition,\nwe apply CBDL to two case studies to demonstrate its downstream tasks\ncapabilities: one, for motion prediction in autonomous driving scenarios, and\ntwo, to model blood glucose and insulin dynamics for artificial pancreas\ncontrol. We show that CBDL performs better when compared to an ensemble of BNNs\nbaseline.",

      "abstract": "The elastic properties of materials derive from their electronic and atomic\nnature. However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not\nfeasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used\ninstead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of\nthe elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far\nelusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by\ntaking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the\ncorresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as\noutput. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and\npore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics\nside, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often\nignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite\nElement Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam\nequipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full\natomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and\nthe FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a\nnew lossless scale bridging approach to such problems. The trained CNN model\ndeviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\\% for porosity scenarios of up to\n90\\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not\nrequire to change simulation methods between different scales. The efficiency\nof the CNN evaluation together with the preservation of important atomistic\neffects makes the trained model an effective atomistically-informed\nconstitutive model for macroscopic simulations of nanoporous materials and\nsolving of inverse problems.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, deep learning has become a major component of artificial\nintelligence. The workhorse of deep learning is the optimization of loss\nfunctions by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Traditionally in deep learning,\nneural networks are differentiable mathematical functions, and the loss\ngradients required for SGD are computed with the backpropagation algorithm.\nHowever, the computer architectures on which these neural networks are\nimplemented and trained suffer from speed and energy inefficiency issues, due\nto the separation of memory and processing in these architectures. To solve\nthese problems, the field of neuromorphic computing aims at implementing neural\nnetworks on hardware architectures that merge memory and processing, just like\nbrains do. In this thesis, we argue that building large, fast and efficient\nneural networks on neuromorphic architectures also requires rethinking the\nalgorithms to implement and train them. We present an alternative mathematical\nframework, also compatible with SGD, which offers the possibility to design\nneural networks in substrates that directly exploit the laws of physics. Our\nframework applies to a very broad class of models, namely those whose state or\ndynamics are described by variational equations. This includes physical systems\nwhose equilibrium state minimizes an energy function, and physical systems\nwhose trajectory minimizes an action functional. We present a simple procedure\nto compute the loss gradients in such systems, called equilibrium propagation\n(EqProp), which requires solely locally available information for each\ntrainable parameter. Since many models in physics and engineering can be\ndescribed by variational principles, our framework has the potential to be\napplied to a broad variety of physical systems whose applications extend to\nvarious fields of engineering, beyond neuromorphic computing.",

Abnormal cell growth in the squamous epithelial\nlining of the cervix leads to cervical cancer in females. A Pap smear is a\ndiagnostic procedure used to detect cervical cancer by gently collecting cells\nfrom the surface of the cervix with a small brush and analyzing their changes\nunder a microscope. For population-based cervical cancer screening, visual\ninspection with acetic acid is a cost-effective method with high sensitivity.\nHowever, Pap smears are also suitable for mass screening due to their higher\nspecificity. The current Pap smear analysis method is manual, time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, and prone to human error. Therefore, an artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based approach for automatic cell classification is needed.\nIn this study, we aimed to classify cells in Pap smear images into five\ncategories: superficial-intermediate, parabasal, koilocytes, dyskeratotic, and\nmetaplastic. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Gradient\nBoosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor, as\nwell as deep learning (DL) approaches like ResNet-50, were employed for this\nclassification task. The ML models demonstrated high classification accuracy;\nhowever, ResNet-50 outperformed the others, achieving a classification accuracy\nof 93.06%.

There are\ninherent trade-offs between each of the pillars (for example, accuracy vs\nfairness or accuracy vs privacy), making it even more important to consider\nthem together. This paper outlines a new framework for Sustainable Machine\nLearning and proposes FPIG, a general AI pipeline that allows for these\ncritical topics to be considered simultaneously to learn the trade-offs between\nthe pillars better. Based on the FPIG framework, we propose a meta-learning\nalgorithm to estimate the four key pillars given a dataset summary, model\narchitecture, and hyperparameters before model training. This algorithm allows\nusers to select the optimal model architecture for a given dataset and a given\nset of user requirements on the pillars. We illustrate the trade-offs under the\nFPIG model on three classical datasets and demonstrate the meta-learning\napproach with an example of real-world datasets and models with different\ninterpretability, showcasing how it can aid model selection.",

In\naddition, many of the proposed state-of-the-art models are very complex and may\nnot be the best fit for different datasets. A promising approach, known as\nAutomated Machine Learning (AutoML), can reduce the domain expertise required\nto implement a custom DL model. AutoML reduces the amount of human\ntrial-and-error involved in designing DL models, and in more recent\nimplementations can find new model architectures with relatively low\ncomputational overhead.\n  This work provides a comprehensive analysis and insights on using AutoML for\nstatic and online malware detection. For static, our analysis is performed on\ntwo widely used malware datasets: SOREL-20M to demonstrate efficacy on large\ndatasets; and EMBER-2018, a smaller dataset specifically curated to hinder the\nperformance of machine learning models. In addition, we show the effects of\ntuning the NAS process parameters on finding a more optimal malware detection\nmodel on these static analysis datasets.

      "abstract": "Theoretical understanding of deep learning is one of the most important tasks\nfacing the statistics and machine learning communities. While deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) originated as engineering methods and models of biological\nnetworks in neuroscience and psychology, they have quickly become a centerpiece\nof the machine learning toolbox. Unfortunately, DNN adoption powered by recent\nsuccesses combined with the open-source nature of the machine learning\ncommunity, has outpaced our theoretical understanding. We cannot reliably\nidentify when and why DNNs will make mistakes. In some applications like text\ntranslation these mistakes may be comical and provide for fun fodder in\nresearch talks, a single error can be very costly in tasks like medical\nimaging. As we utilize DNNs in increasingly sensitive applications, a better\nunderstanding of their properties is thus imperative. Recent advances in DNN\ntheory are numerous and include many different sources of intuition, such as\nlearning theory, sparse signal analysis, physics, chemistry, and psychology. An\ninteresting pattern begins to emerge in the breadth of possible\ninterpretations. The seemingly limitless approaches are mostly constrained by\nthe lens with which the mathematical operations are viewed. Ultimately, the\ninterpretation of DNNs appears to mimic a type of Rorschach test --- a\npsychological test wherein subjects interpret a series of seemingly ambiguous\nink-blots. Validation for DNN theory requires a convergence of the literature.\nWe must distinguish between universal results that are invariant to the\nanalysis perspective and those that are specific to a particular network\nconfiguration. Simultaneously we must deal with the fact that many standard\nstatistical tools for quantifying generalization or empirically assessing\nimportant network features are difficult to apply to DNNs.",

      "abstract": "Computational protein design has a wide variety of applications. Despite its\nremarkable success, designing a protein for a given structure and function is\nstill a challenging task. On the other hand, the number of solved protein\nstructures is rapidly increasing while the number of unique protein folds has\nreached a steady number, suggesting more structural information is being\naccumulated on each fold. Deep learning neural network is a powerful method to\nlearn such big data set and has shown superior performance in many machine\nlearning fields. In this study, we applied the deep learning neural network\napproach to computational protein design for predicting the probability of 20\nnatural amino acids on each residue in a protein. A large set of protein\nstructures was collected and a multi-layer neural network was constructed. A\nnumber of structural properties were extracted as input features and the best\nnetwork achieved an accuracy of 38.3%. Using the network output as residue type\nrestraints was able to improve the average sequence identity in designing three\nnatural proteins using Rosetta. Moreover, the predictions from our network show\n~3% higher sequence identity than a previous method. Results from this study\nmay benefit further development of computational protein design methods.",

This can become tedious\nfor both parties, leading to a need for a solution. In response, this paper\nproposes a chatbot model that utilizes natural language processing and deep\nlearning techniques to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) in the Amharic\nlanguage. Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation\nthrough the use of artificial intelligence (AI), acting as a virtual assistant\nto handle questions and other tasks. The proposed chatbot program employs\ntokenization, normalization, stop word removal, and stemming to analyze and\ncategorize Amharic input sentences. Three machine learning model algorithms\nwere used to classify tokens and retrieve appropriate responses: Support Vector\nMachine (SVM), Multinomial Na\\\"ive Bayes, and deep neural networks implemented\nthrough TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK. The deep learning model achieved the best\nresults with 91.55% accuracy and a validation loss of 0.3548 using an Adam\noptimizer and SoftMax activation function. The chatbot model was integrated\nwith Facebook Messenger and deployed on a Heroku server for 24-hour\naccessibility. The experimental results demonstrate that the chatbot framework\nachieved its objectives and effectively addressed challenges such as Amharic\nFidel variation, morphological variation, and lexical gaps. Future research\ncould explore the integration of Amharic WordNet to narrow the lexical gap and\nsupport more complex questions.",

      "abstract": "Producing an artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been an elusive goal\nin artificial intelligence (AI) research for some time. An AGI would have the\ncapability, like a human, to be exposed to a new problem domain, learn about it\nand then use reasoning processes to make decisions. While AI techniques have\nbeen used across a wide variety of problem domains, an AGI would require an AI\nthat could reason beyond its programming and training. This paper presents a\nsmall step towards producing an AGI. It describes a mechanism for an AI to\nlearn about and develop reasoning pathways to make decisions in an a priori\nunknown domain. It combines a classical AI technique, the expert system, with a\nits modern adaptation - the gradient descent trained expert system (GDTES) -\nand utilizes generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to create a network and\ntraining data set for this system. These can be created from available sources\nor may draw upon knowledge incorporated in a GAI's own pre-trained model. The\nlearning process in GDTES is used to optimize the AI's decision-making. While\nthis approach does not meet the standards that many have defined for an AGI, it\nprovides a somewhat similar capability, albeit one which requires a learning\nprocess before use.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning, has driven most\nof the recent fundamental developments in artificial intelligence. Deep\nlearning is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent,\nbio-inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units\noperating in parallel. Deep learning has been successfully applied in areas\nsuch as object/pattern recognition, speech and natural language processing,\nself-driving vehicles, intelligent self-diagnostics tools, autonomous robots,\nknowledgeable personal assistants, and monitoring. These successes have been\nmostly supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data,\ncontinuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The\napproaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest\nimprovements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raise the\nquestion of whether the described progress will be slowed or halted due to\nhardware limitations. This paper reviews the case for a novel beyond CMOS\nhardware technology, memristors, as a potential solution for the implementation\nof power-efficient in-memory computing, deep learning accelerators, and spiking\nneural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non-von-Neumann computing\narchitectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference\nalgorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing\ndirections for further progress in artificial intelligence, we briefly discuss\nan example based reservoir computing. We conclude the review by speculating on\nthe big picture view of future neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing\nsystems.",

There is a need for ethical considerations as these entities\nare beginning to depend on AI for delivering various crucial tasks, which\nimmensely influence their operations, decision-making, and interactions with\neach other. The adoption of ethical principles, guidelines, and standards of\nwork is therefore required throughout the entire process of AI development,\ndeployment, and usage to ensure responsible and ethical AI practices. Our\ndiscussion explores eleven fundamental 'ethical principles' structured as\noverarching themes. These encompass Transparency, Justice, Fairness, Equity,\nNon- Maleficence, Responsibility, Accountability, Privacy, Beneficence,\nFreedom, Autonomy, Trust, Dignity, Sustainability, and Solidarity. These\nprinciples collectively serve as a guiding framework, directing the ethical\npath for the responsible development, deployment, and utilization of artificial\nintelligence (AI) technologies across diverse sectors and entities within the\nUnited States. The paper also discusses the revolutionary impact of AI\napplications, such as Machine Learning, and explores various approaches used to\nimplement AI ethics.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder that typically emerges in late\nadolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by\n15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and\nreality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have\nrevealed that SZ affects the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions\nof the brain. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased\nvolume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used to explore\nstructural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder, owing to its high\nspatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been\nemployed with advanced image/signal processing methods to accurately diagnose\nSZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of studies conducted on the\nautomated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. First, an AI-based computer\naided-diagnosis system (CADS) for SZ diagnosis and its relevant sections are\npresented. Then, this section introduces the most important conventional\nmachine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the diagnosis of\ndiagnosing SZ. A comprehensive comparison is also made between ML and DL\nstudies in the discussion section. In the following, the most important\nchallenges in diagnosing SZ are addressed. Future works in diagnosing SZ using\nAI techniques and MRI modalities are recommended in another section. Results,\nconclusion, and research findings are also presented at the end.",

      "abstract": "Current advances in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in general,\nand deep learning in particular have reached unprecedented impact not only\nacross research communities, but also over popular media channels. However,\nconcerns about interpretability and accountability of AI have been raised by\ninfluential thinkers. In spite of the recent impact of AI, several works have\nidentified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning\nmechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and\nexplainable models for such systems. Neural-symbolic computing aims at\nintegrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities:\nthe ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what\nhas been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of\nresearch for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in\nneural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation.\nIn this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as\na principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We\nillustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main\ncharacteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning\nwith symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the\nconstruction of explainable AI systems. The insights provided by\nneural-symbolic computing shed new light on the increasingly prominent need for\ninterpretable and accountable AI systems.",

      "abstract": "The use of synthetic data is recognized as a crucial step in the development\nof neural network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While the methods\nfor generating synthetic data for AI applications in other domains have a role\nin certain biomedical AI systems, primarily related to image processing, there\nis a critical gap in the generation of time series data for AI tasks where it\nis necessary to know how the system works. This is most pronounced in the\nability to generate synthetic multi-dimensional molecular time series data\n(SMMTSD); this is the type of data that underpins research into biomarkers and\nmediator signatures for forecasting various diseases and is an essential\ncomponent of the drug development pipeline. We argue the insufficiency of\nstatistical and data-centric machine learning (ML) means of generating this\ntype of synthetic data is due to a combination of factors: perpetual data\nsparsity due to the Curse of Dimensionality, the inapplicability of the Central\nLimit Theorem, and the limits imposed by the Causal Hierarchy Theorem.\nAlternatively, we present a rationale for using complex multi-scale\nmechanism-based simulation models, constructed and operated on to account for\nepistemic incompleteness and the need to provide maximal expansiveness in\nconcordance with the Principle of Maximal Entropy. These procedures provide for\nthe generation of SMMTD that minimizes the known shortcomings associated with\nneural network AI systems, namely overfitting and lack of generalizability. The\ngeneration of synthetic data that accounts for the identified factors of\nmulti-dimensional time series data is an essential capability for the\ndevelopment of mediator-biomarker based AI forecasting systems, and therapeutic\ncontrol development and optimization through systems like Drug Development\nDigital Twins.",

The World\nBank report on education has indicated that the learning gap created by this\nproblem causes many students to drop out (World Development Report, 2018).\nPersonalised learning has been able to solve this grave problem.",

This work focused on\ndeveloping CXR interpretation-assisting Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nmethodology with: 1. 100% detection for LLIED presence/location; and 2. High\nclassification in LLIED typing. Materials & Methods: Data-mining\n(03/1993-02/2021) produced an AI Model Development Population (1,100\npatients/4,871 images) creating 4,924 LLIED Region-Of-Interests (ROIs) (with\nimage-quality grading) used in Training, Validation, and Testing. For\ndeveloping the cascading neural network (detection via Faster R-CNN and\nclassification via Inception V3), \"ground-truth\" CXR annotation (ROI labeling\nper LLIED), as well as inference display (as Generated Bounding Boxes (GBBs)),\nrelied on a GPU-based graphical user interface. Results: To achieve 100% LLIED\ndetection, probability threshold reduction to 0.00002 was required by Model 1,\nresulting in increasing GBBs per LLIED-related ROI. Targeting LLIED-type\nclassification following detection of all LLIEDs, Model 2 multi-classified to\nreach high-performance while decreasing falsely positive GBBs. Despite 24%\nsuboptimal ROI image quality, classification was correct in 98.9% and AUCs for\nthe 9 LLIED-types were 1.00 for 8 and 0.92 for 1. For all misclassification\ncases: 1.

The first wave, from\nthe mid-1950s to the 1980s, focused on logic and symbolic hand-encoded\nrepresentations of knowledge, the foundations of so-called \"expert systems\".\nThe second wave, starting in the 1990s, focused on statistics and machine\nlearning, in which, instead of hand-programming rules for behavior, programmers\nconstructed \"statistical learning algorithms\" that could be trained on large\ndatasets. In the most recent wave research in AI has largely focused on deep\n(i.e., many-layered) neural networks, which are loosely inspired by the brain\nand trained by \"deep learning\" methods. However, while deep neural networks\nhave led to many successes and new capabilities in computer vision, speech\nrecognition, language processing, game-playing, and robotics, their potential\nfor broad application remains limited by several factors.\n  A concerning limitation is that even the most successful of today's AI\nsystems suffer from brittleness-they can fail in unexpected ways when faced\nwith situations that differ sufficiently from ones they have been trained on.\nThis lack of robustness also appears in the vulnerability of AI systems to\nadversarial attacks, in which an adversary can subtly manipulate data in a way\nto guarantee a specific wrong answer or action from an AI system. AI systems\nalso can absorb biases-based on gender, race, or other factors-from their\ntraining data and further magnify these biases in their subsequent\ndecision-making.

New applications of AI\nacross societal domains and public organizations and infrastructures come with\nnew hazards, which lead to new forms of harm, both grave and pernicious. The\ntext addresses the lack of consensus for diagnosing and eliminating new AI\nsystem hazards. For decades, the field of system safety has dealt with\naccidents and harm in safety-critical systems governed by varying degrees of\nsoftware-based automation and decision-making. This field embraces the core\nassumption of systems and control that AI systems cannot be safeguarded by\ntechnical design choices on the model or algorithm alone, instead requiring an\nend-to-end hazard analysis and design frame that includes the context of use,\nimpacted stakeholders and the formal and informal institutional environment in\nwhich the system operates. Safety and other values are then inherently\nsocio-technical and emergent system properties that require design and control\nmeasures to instantiate these across the technical, social and institutional\ncomponents of a system. This chapter honors system safety pioneer Nancy\nLeveson, by situating her core lessons for today's AI system safety challenges.\nFor every lesson, concrete tools are offered for rethinking and reorganizing\nthe safety management of AI systems, both in design and governance. This\nhistory tells us that effective AI safety management requires transdisciplinary\napproaches and a shared language that allows involvement of all levels of\nsociety.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems are integrated into high stakes social domains, researchers now\nexamine how to design and operate them in a safe and ethical manner. However,\nthe criteria for identifying and diagnosing safety risks in complex social\ncontexts remain unclear and contested. In this paper, we examine the vagueness\nin debates about the safety and ethical behavior of AI systems. We show how\nthis vagueness cannot be resolved through mathematical formalism alone, instead\nrequiring deliberation about the politics of development as well as the context\nof deployment. Drawing from a new sociotechnical lexicon, we redefine vagueness\nin terms of distinct design challenges at key stages in AI system development.\nThe resulting framework of Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence (HCAI)\nempowers developers by 1) identifying points of overlap between design\ndecisions and major sociotechnical challenges; 2) motivating the creation of\nstakeholder feedback channels so that safety issues can be exhaustively\naddressed. As such, HCAI contributes to a timely debate about the status of AI\ndevelopment in democratic societies, arguing that deliberation should be the\ngoal of AI Safety, not just the procedure by which it is ensured.",

      "abstract": "Potential advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could have profound\nimplications for how countries research and develop weapons systems, and how\nmilitaries deploy those systems on the battlefield. The idea of AI-enabled\nmilitary systems has motivated some activists to call for restrictions or bans\non some weapon systems, while others have argued that AI may be too diffuse to\ncontrol. This paper argues that while a ban on all military applications of AI\nis likely infeasible, there may be specific cases where arms control is\npossible. Throughout history, the international community has attempted to ban\nor regulate weapons or military systems for a variety of reasons. This paper\nanalyzes both successes and failures and offers several criteria that seem to\ninfluence why arms control works in some cases and not others. We argue that\nsuccess or failure depends on the desirability (i.e., a weapon's military value\nversus its perceived horribleness) and feasibility (i.e., sociopolitical\nfactors that influence its success) of arms control. Based on these criteria,\nand the historical record of past attempts at arms control, we analyze the\npotential for AI arms control in the future and offer recommendations for what\npolicymakers can do today.",

However as usually, everything\ncomes with a price and in this case, the price to pay is to loose\ninterpretability of a model while gaining on its accuracy and precision. For\nmanagers to control and effectively manage credit risk and for regulators to be\nconvinced with model quality the price to pay is too high. In this paper, we\nshow how to take credit scoring analytics in to the next level, namely we\npresent comparison of various predictive models (logistic regression, logistic\nregression with weight of evidence transformations and modern artificial\nintelligence algorithms) and show that advanced tree based models give best\nresults in prediction of client default. What is even more important and\nvaluable we also show how to boost advanced models using techniques which allow\nto interpret them and made them more accessible for credit risk practitioners,\nresolving the crucial obstacle in widespread deployment of more complex, 'black\nbox' models like random forests, gradient boosted or extreme gradient boosted\ntrees. All this will be shown on the large dataset obtained from the Polish\nCredit Bureau to which all the banks and most of the lending companies in the\ncountry do report the credit files. In this paper the data from lending\ncompanies were used. The paper then compares state of the art best practices in\ncredit risk modelling with new advanced modern statistical tools boosted by the\nlatest developments in the field of interpretability and explainability of\nartificial intelligence algorithms. We believe that this is a valuable\ncontribution when it comes to presentation of different modelling tools but\nwhat is even more important it is showing which methods might be used to get\ninsight and understanding of AI methods in credit risk context.",

Here we argue that the path towards\nsymbolically fluent artificial intelligence (AI) begins with a reinterpretation\nof what symbols are, how they come to exist, and how a system behaves when it\nuses them. We begin by offering an interpretation of symbols as entities whose\nmeaning is established by convention. But crucially, something is a symbol only\nfor those who demonstrably and actively participate in this convention. We then\noutline how this interpretation thematically unifies the behavioural traits\nhumans exhibit when they use symbols. This motivates our proposal that the\nfield place a greater emphasis on symbolic behaviour rather than particular\ncomputational mechanisms inspired by more restrictive interpretations of\nsymbols. Finally, we suggest that AI research explore social and cultural\nengagement as a tool to develop the cognitive machinery necessary for symbolic\nbehaviour to emerge. This approach will allow for AI to interpret something as\nsymbolic on its own rather than simply manipulate things that are only symbols\nto human onlookers, and thus will ultimately lead to AI with more human-like\nsymbolic fluency.",

The study is based on 89 real-world ML attack scenarios\nfrom the MITRE's ATLAS database, the AI Incident Database, and the literature;\n854 ML repositories from the GitHub search and the Python Packaging Advisory\ndatabase, selected based on their reputation. Attacks from the AI Incident\nDatabase and the literature are used to identify vulnerabilities and new types\nof threats that were not documented in ATLAS. Results show that convolutional\nneural networks were one of the most targeted models among the attack\nscenarios. ML repositories with the largest vulnerability prominence include\nTensorFlow, OpenCV, and Notebook. In this paper, we also report the most\nfrequent vulnerabilities in the studied ML repositories, the most targeted ML\nphases and models, the most used TTPs in ML phases and attack scenarios. This\ninformation is particularly important for red/blue teams to better conduct\nattacks/defenses, for practitioners to prevent threats during ML development,\nand for researchers to develop efficient defense mechanisms.",

A DL model aims to\ndetect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19,\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal\nconditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the\naffected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better\nunderstanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either\nindependently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and\nAlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model\ndevelopment, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope\nwith the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical\napplications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented\nto withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency",

      "abstract": "One major criticism of deep learning centers around the biological\nimplausibility of the credit assignment schema used for learning --\nbackpropagation of errors. This implausibility translates into practical\nlimitations, spanning scientific fields, including incompatibility with\nhardware and non-differentiable implementations, thus leading to expensive\nenergy requirements. In contrast, biologically plausible credit assignment is\ncompatible with practically any learning condition and is energy-efficient. As\na result, it accommodates hardware and scientific modeling, e.g. learning with\nphysical systems and non-differentiable behavior. Furthermore, it can lead to\nthe development of real-time, adaptive neuromorphic processing systems. In\naddressing this problem, an interdisciplinary branch of artificial intelligence\nresearch that lies at the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and\nmachine learning has emerged. In this paper, we survey several vital algorithms\nthat model bio-plausible rules of credit assignment in artificial neural\nnetworks, discussing the solutions they provide for different scientific fields\nas well as their advantages on CPUs, GPUs, and novel implementations of\nneuromorphic hardware. We conclude by discussing the future challenges that\nwill need to be addressed in order to make such algorithms more useful in\npractical applications.",

Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review\ninvestigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk\nprediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore,\nPubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search\nstrategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on\npeer-reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets.\nThirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis.\nThe results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top\nmodel-agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage,\nexplaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of\nbiomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model\nprimarily explained tree-based ensemble machine learning models. The most\ncommon reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and\nuseful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy\nto implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as\ntree-based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability,\nfairness, and trustworthiness of AI-enabled health systems and medical devices\nand, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.",

Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, which\nhas been greatly progressed through developing large and intricate AI models.\nHowever, the lack of transparency is a big challenge that may not allow the\nwidespread adoption of these models. Explainable artificial intelligence is a\nfield of research where methods are developed to help users understand the\nbehavior, decision logics, and vulnerabilities of AI systems. Previously, few\nexplanation methods were developed for object detection based on random\nmasking. However, random masks may raise some issues regarding the actual\nimportance of pixels within an image. In this paper, we design and implement a\nblack-box explanation method named Black-box Object Detection Explanation by\nMasking (BODEM) through adopting a hierarchical random masking approach for\nobject detection systems. We propose a hierarchical random masking framework in\nwhich coarse-grained masks are used in lower levels to find salient regions\nwithin an image, and fine-grained mask are used to refine the salient regions\nin higher levels. Experimentations on various object detection datasets and\nmodels showed that BODEM can effectively explain the behavior of object\ndetectors. Moreover, our method outperformed Detector Randomized Input Sampling\nfor Explanation (D-RISE) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations\n(LIME) with respect to different quantitative measures of explanation\neffectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that BODEM can be an\neffective method for explaining and validating object detection systems in\nblack-box testing scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The presence of decision-making algorithms in society is rapidly increasing\nnowadays, while concerns about their transparency and the possibility of these\nalgorithms becoming new sources of discrimination are arising. There is a\ncertain consensus about the need to develop AI applications with a\nHuman-Centric approach. Human-Centric Machine Learning needs to be developed\nbased on four main requirements: (i) utility and social good; (ii) privacy and\ndata ownership; (iii) transparency and accountability; and (iv) fairness in\nAI-driven decision-making processes. All these four Human-Centric requirements\nare closely related to each other. With the aim of studying how current\nmultimodal algorithms based on heterogeneous sources of information are\naffected by sensitive elements and inner biases in the data, we propose a\nfictitious case study focused on automated recruitment: FairCVtest. We train\nautomatic recruitment algorithms using a set of multimodal synthetic profiles\nincluding image, text, and structured data, which are consciously scored with\ngender and racial biases. FairCVtest shows the capacity of the Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) behind automatic recruitment tools built this way (a common\npractice in many other application scenarios beyond recruitment) to extract\nsensitive information from unstructured data and exploit it in combination to\ndata biases in undesirable (unfair) ways. We present an overview of recent\nworks developing techniques capable of removing sensitive information and\nbiases from the decision-making process of deep learning architectures, as well\nas commonly used databases for fairness research in AI. We demonstrate how\nlearning approaches developed to guarantee privacy in latent spaces can lead to\nunbiased and fair automatic decision-making process.",

It transpires as a result of accumulation of watery fluids\nbehind the retina. Therefore, detection of CSR at early stages allows\npreventive measures to avert any impairment to the human eye. Traditionally,\nseveral manual methods for detecting CSR have been developed in the past;\nhowever, they have shown to be imprecise and unreliable. Consequently,\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) services in the medical field, including automated\nCSR detection, are now possible to detect and cure this disease. This review\nassessed a variety of innovative technologies and researches that contribute to\nthe automatic detection of CSR. In this review, various CSR disease detection\ntechniques, broadly classified into two categories: a) CSR detection based on\nclassical imaging technologies, and b) CSR detection based on Machine/Deep\nLearning methods, have been reviewed after an elaborated evaluation of 29\ndifferent relevant articles. Additionally, it also goes over the advantages,\ndrawbacks and limitations of a variety of traditional imaging techniques, such\nas Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), Fundus Imaging and more\nrecent approaches that utilize Artificial Intelligence techniques. Finally, it\nis concluded that the most recent Deep Learning (DL) classifiers deliver\naccurate, fast, and reliable CSR detection.

Part I introduces stochastic\nrecurrent networks: Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines. The analysis of\ntheir learning rules sets the scene for the later parts. Part II describes\nsupervised learning with multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural\nnetworks. This part starts with a simple geometrical interpretation of the\nlearning rule and leads to the recent successes of convolutional networks in\nobject recognition, recurrent networks in language processing, and reservoir\ncomputers in time-series analysis. Part III explains what neural networks can\nlearn about data that is not labeled. This part begins with a description of\nunsupervised learning techniques for clustering of data, non-linear\nprojections, and embeddings. A section on autoencoders explains how to learn\nwithout labels using convolutional networks, and the last chapter is dedicated\nto reinforcement learning. The overall goal of the course is to explain the\nfundamental principles that allow neural networks to learn, emphasising ideas\nand concepts that are common to all three parts.\n  The present version does not contain exercises (copyright owned by Cambridge\nUniversity Press).

However, they are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks that seek to misguide the models into predicting incorrect classes. Our\nstudy of major adversarial attack models shows that they all specifically\ntarget and exploit the neural networking structures in their designs. This\nunderstanding makes us develop a hypothesis that most classical machine\nlearning models, such as Random Forest (RF), are immune to adversarial attack\nmodels because they do not rely on neural network design at all. Our\nexperimental study of classical machine learning models against popular\nadversarial attacks supports this hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis, we\npropose a new adversarial-aware deep learning system by using a classical\nmachine learning model as the secondary verification system to complement the\nprimary deep learning model in image classification. Although the secondary\nclassical machine learning model has less accurate output, it is only used for\nverification purposes, which does not impact the output accuracy of the primary\ndeep learning model, and at the same time, can effectively detect an\nadversarial attack when a clear mismatch occurs. Our experiments based on\nCIFAR-100 dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art adversarial defense systems.",

To address this priority area, the Moving Picture,\nAudio, and Data Coding by Artificial Intelligence (MPAI) group is developing a\nsuite of standards called MPAI-EEV for \"end-to-end optimized neural video\ncoding.\" The aim of this AI-based video standard project is to compress the\nnumber of bits required to represent high-fidelity video data by utilizing\ndata-trained neural coding technologies. This approach is not constrained by\nhow data coding has traditionally been applied in the context of a hybrid\nframework. This paper presents an overview of recent and ongoing\nstandardization efforts in this area and highlights the key technologies and\ndesign philosophy of EEV. It also provides a comparison and report on some\nprimary efforts such as the coding efficiency of the reference model.\nAdditionally, it discusses emerging activities such as learned\nUnmanned-Aerial-Vehicles (UAVs) video coding which are currently planned, under\ndevelopment, or in the exploration phase. With a focus on UAV video signals,\nthis paper addresses the current status of these preliminary efforts. It also\nindicates development timelines, summarizes the main technical details, and\nprovides pointers to further points of reference.

      "abstract": "More and more companies have deployed machine learning (ML) clusters, where\ndeep learning (DL) models are trained for providing various AI-driven services.\nEfficient resource scheduling is essential for maximal utilization of expensive\nDL clusters. Existing cluster schedulers either are agnostic to ML workload\ncharacteristics, or use scheduling heuristics based on operators' understanding\nof particular ML framework and workload, which are less efficient or not\ngeneral enough. In this paper, we show that DL techniques can be adopted to\ndesign a generic and efficient scheduler. DL2 is a DL-driven scheduler for DL\nclusters, targeting global training job expedition by dynamically resizing\nresources allocated to jobs. DL2 advocates a joint supervised learning and\nreinforcement learning approach: a neural network is warmed up via offline\nsupervised learning based on job traces produced by the existing cluster\nscheduler; then the neural network is plugged into the live DL cluster,\nfine-tuned by reinforcement learning carried out throughout the training\nprogress of the DL jobs, and used for deciding job resource allocation in an\nonline fashion. By applying past decisions made by the existing cluster\nscheduler in the preparatory supervised learning phase, our approach enables a\nsmooth transition from existing scheduler, and renders a high-quality scheduler\nin minimizing average training completion time. We implement DL2 on Kubernetes\nand enable dynamic resource scaling in DL jobs on MXNet. Extensive evaluation\nshows that DL2 outperforms fairness scheduler (i.e., DRF) by 44.1% and expert\nheuristic scheduler (i.e., Optimus) by 17.5% in terms of average job completion\ntime.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that can make\ndeep learning models more transparent and explainable to a user. Some\nresearchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve a certain degree of\nhuman-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally\nunderstandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of\nalgorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals.\nThis paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing body\nof literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial\nintelligence. We performed an LDA topic modelling analysis under a PRISMA\nframework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis resulted\nin a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed\nalgorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications in\nreal-world data. This research suggests that current model-agnostic\ncounterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal\ntheoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human\ndecision-maker. Our findings suggest that the explanations derived from major\nalgorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than\ncause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous or even biased\nexplanations. This paper also advances the literature with new directions and\nchallenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for\nexplainable artificial intelligence.",

Most popular at the time of this\nwriting are artificial intelligence methodologies that fall under the umbrella\nof deep learning. Deep learning has been shown across many applications to be\nextremely powerful and capable of handling problems that possess great\ncomplexity and difficulty. In this work, we introduce a new layer to deep\nlearning: the fuzzy layer. Traditionally, the network architecture of neural\nnetworks is composed of an input layer, some combination of hidden layers, and\nan output layer. We propose the introduction of fuzzy layers into the deep\nlearning architecture to exploit the powerful aggregation properties expressed\nthrough fuzzy methodologies, such as the Choquet and Sugueno fuzzy integrals.\nTo date, fuzzy approaches taken to deep learning have been through the\napplication of various fusion strategies at the decision level to aggregate\noutputs from state-of-the-art pre-trained models, e.g., AlexNet, VGG16,\nGoogLeNet, Inception-v3, ResNet-18, etc. While these strategies have been shown\nto improve accuracy performance for image classification tasks, none have\nexplored the use of fuzzified intermediate, or hidden, layers. Herein, we\npresent a new deep learning strategy that incorporates fuzzy strategies into\nthe deep learning architecture focused on the application of semantic\nsegmentation using per-pixel classification. Experiments are conducted on a\nbenchmark data set as well as a data set collected via an unmanned aerial\nsystem at a U.S. Army test site for the task of automatic road segmentation,\nand preliminary results are promising.",

The purpose of the paper is to discuss the\npotential advantages of gene recommendation performed by artificial\nintelligence (AI). Indeed, gene recommendation engines try to solve this\nproblem: if the user is interested in a set of genes, which other genes are\nlikely to be related to the starting set and should be investigated? This task\nwas solved with a custom deep learning recommendation engine, DeepProphet2\n(DP2), which is freely available to researchers worldwide via\nhttps://www.generecommender.com?utm_source=DeepProphet2_paper&utm_medium=pdf.\nHereafter, insights behind the algorithm and its practical applications are\nillustrated.\n  The gene recommendation problem can be addressed by mapping the genes to a\nmetric space where a distance can be defined to represent the real semantic\ndistance between them. To achieve this objective a transformer-based model has\nbeen trained on a well-curated freely available paper corpus, PubMed. The paper\ndescribes multiple optimization procedures that were employed to obtain the\nbest bias-variance trade-off, focusing on embedding size and network depth. In\nthis context, the model's ability to discover sets of genes implicated in\ndiseases and pathways was assessed through cross-validation. A simple\nassumption guided the procedure: the network had no direct knowledge of\npathways and diseases but learned genes' similarities and the interactions\namong them. Moreover, to further investigate the space where the neural network\nrepresents genes, the dimensionality of the embedding was reduced, and the\nresults were projected onto a human-comprehensible space. In conclusion, a set\nof use cases illustrates the algorithm's potential applications in a real word\nsetting.",

Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories\nuse historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our\nintellectual, political, economic, and social world.

We\nhighlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using\na decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of\nartificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking\nreverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and\npolitical communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific\nbreakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon\nAI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and\nthe multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us; ultimately\nsupporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of\nbeneficence and justice for all.",

However, the decision logic of these frameworks is often not\ntransparent, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand, interpret or\nexplain their behavior. This limitation hinders trust in machine learning\nsystems and causes a general reluctance towards their adoption in practical\napplications, particularly in mission-critical domains like healthcare and\nautonomous driving. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques facilitate the\nexplainability or interpretability of machine learning models, enabling users\nto discern the basis of the decision and possibly avert undesirable behavior.\nThis comprehensive survey details the advancements of explainable AI methods,\nfrom inherently interpretable models to modern approaches for achieving\ninterpretability of various black box models, including large language models\n(LLMs). Additionally, we review explainable AI techniques that leverage LLM and\nvision-language model (VLM) frameworks to automate or improve the\nexplainability of other machine learning models. The use of LLM and VLM as\ninterpretability methods particularly enables high-level, semantically\nmeaningful explanations of model decisions and behavior. Throughout the paper,\nwe highlight the scientific principles, strengths and weaknesses of\nstate-of-the-art methods and outline different areas of improvement.

      "abstract": "In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the\ngrowing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that\noften do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose\noptimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a\ngeneral purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence\n(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential\nfunctions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare\npolicies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial\nintelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines\nMarkov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical\ndata and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential\ndecision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic\ninteractions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in\npartially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)\nby maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an\nonline agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real\npatient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily\noutperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service\nmodels of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a\n30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further\nenhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly\nhalf the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation\nframework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain\nenvironments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of\nresearch and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized\nmedicine.",

However, channel estimation and signal detection are very\nchallenging for CP-free OFDM systems. In this paper, we propose a novel\nartificial intelligence (AI)-aided receiver (AI receiver) for a CP-free OFDM\nsystem. The AI receiver includes a channel estimation neural network (CE-NET)\nand a signal detection neural network based on orthogonal approximate message\npassing (OAMP), called OAMP-NET. The CE-NET is initialized by the least-square\nchannel estimation algorithm and refined by a linear minimum mean-squared error\nneural network. The OAMP-NET is established by unfolding the iterative OAMP\nalgorithm and adding several trainable parameters to improve the detection\nperformance. We first investigate their performance under different channel\nmodels through extensive simulation and then establish a real transmission\nsystem using a 5G rapid prototyping system for an over-the-air (OTA) test.\nBased on our study, the AI receiver can estimate time-varying channels with a\nsingle training phase. It also has great robustness to various imperfections\nand has better performance than those competitive algorithms, especially for\nhigh-order modulation. The OTA test further verifies its feasibility to real\nenvironments and indicates its potential for future communications systems.",

      "abstract": "The success of deep learning comes at a tremendous computational and energy\ncost, and the scalability of training massively overparametrized neural\nnetworks is becoming a real barrier to the progress of artificial intelligence\n(AI). Despite the popularity and low cost-per-iteration of traditional\nbackpropagation via gradient decent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has\nprohibitive convergence rate in non-convex settings, both in theory and\npractice.\n  To mitigate this cost, recent works have proposed to employ alternative\n(Newton-type) training methods with much faster convergence rate, albeit with\nhigher cost-per-iteration. For a typical neural network with\n$m=\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ parameters and input batch of $n$ datapoints in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, the previous work of [Brand, Peng, Song, and Weinstein,\nITCS'2021] requires $\\sim mnd + n^3$ time per iteration. In this paper, we\npresent a novel training method that requires only $m^{1-\\alpha} n d + n^3$\namortized time in the same overparametrized regime, where $\\alpha \\in (0.01,1)$\nis some fixed constant. This method relies on a new and alternative view of\nneural networks, as a set of binary search trees, where each iteration\ncorresponds to modifying a small subset of the nodes in the tree.

Due to the recent\nhigh interest in radiological images and AI, early detection of diseases in\nX-ray images has become notably more essential to prevent further spreading and\nflatten the curve. Innovations and revolutions of Computer Vision with Deep\nlearning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate diagnosis of\nscreening and detection from chest X-ray images (CXR). This work presents rapid\ndetection of diseases in the lung using the efficient Deep learning pre-trained\nRepVGG algorithm for deep feature extraction and classification.

Employ\nROI object to improve the detection accuracy for lung extraction, followed by\ndata pre-processing and augmentation. We are applying Artificial Intelligence\ntechnology for automatic highlighted detection of affected areas of people's\nlungs. Based on the X-Ray images, an algorithm was developed that classifies\nX-Ray images with height accuracy and power faster thanks to the architecture\ntransformation of the model.

AI can be leveraged to enhance the\nefficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce\ntraffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic\nManagement (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system\nemploys the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic\nmanagement images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the\nnext 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory\n(RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the\ntraffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the\nresults of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12\nhours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error\n(MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles.\nAfter simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found\nthat the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per\nminute) is 50\\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per\nminute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5\nseconds per vehicle) is 70\\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per\nvehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase\ntraffic flow by 50\\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\\%.",

      "abstract": "There are two big unsolved mathematical questions in artificial intelligence\n(AI): (1) Why is deep learning so successful in classification problems and (2)\nwhy are neural nets based on deep learning at the same time universally\nunstable, where the instabilities make the networks vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. We present a solution to these questions that can be summed up in two\nwords; false structures. Indeed, deep learning does not learn the original\nstructures that humans use when recognising images (cats have whiskers, paws,\nfur, pointy ears, etc), but rather different false structures that correlate\nwith the original structure and hence yield the success. However, the false\nstructure, unlike the original structure, is unstable. The false structure is\nsimpler than the original structure, hence easier to learn with less data and\nthe numerical algorithm used in the training will more easily converge to the\nneural network that captures the false structure. We formally define the\nconcept of false structures and formulate the solution as a conjecture. Given\nthat trained neural networks always are computed with approximations, this\nconjecture can only be established through a combination of theoretical and\ncomputational results similar to how one establishes a postulate in theoretical\nphysics (e.g. the speed of light is constant). Establishing the conjecture\nfully will require a vast research program characterising the false structures.\nWe provide the foundations for such a program establishing the existence of the\nfalse structures in practice. Finally, we discuss the far reaching consequences\nthe existence of the false structures has on state-of-the-art AI and Smale's\n18th problem.",

The\nnew techniques, considered as an advanced form of Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nbring previously unforeseen capabilities.

      "abstract": "Recent machine learning approaches have been effective in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) applications. They produce robust results with a high level\nof accuracy. However, most of these techniques do not provide\nhuman-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions.\nThey usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions\nhave been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received\nmuch interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for\ndecision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture,\nrelated domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to\nbackground knowledge. The application of the data mining process on\nagricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain.\nIn this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an\nXAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only\nconsider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the\nsemantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map\nmodel, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to\nprovide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values\ncontribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on\nproviding consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and\nvalues involved in the data mining models. We built an Agriculture Computing\nOntology (AgriComO) to explain the knowledge mined in agriculture. AgriComO has\na well-designed structure and includes a wide range of concepts and\ntransformations suitable for agriculture and computing domains.",

Simultaneously, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) incorporating\nbiologically-feasible spiking neurons have held great promise because of their\nrich temporal dynamics and high-power efficiency. However, the developments in\nSNNs were proceeding separately from those in ANNs, effectively limiting the\nadoption of deep learning research insights. Here we show an alternative\nperspective on the spiking neuron that casts it as a particular ANN construct\ncalled Spiking Neural Unit (SNU), and a soft SNU (sSNU) variant that\ngeneralizes its dynamics to a novel recurrent ANN unit. SNUs bridge the\nbiologically-inspired SNNs with ANNs and provide a methodology for seamless\ninclusion of spiking neurons in deep learning architectures. Furthermore, SNU\nenables highly-efficient in-memory acceleration of SNNs trained with\nbackpropagation through time, implemented with the hardware in-the-loop. We\napply SNUs to tasks ranging from hand-written digit recognition, language\nmodelling, to music prediction. We obtain accuracy comparable to, or better\nthan, that of state-of-the-art ANNs, and we experimentally verify the efficacy\nof the in-memory-based SNN realization for the music-prediction task using\n52,800 phase-change memory devices. The new generation of neural units\nintroduced in this paper incorporate biologically-inspired neural dynamics in\ndeep learning. In addition, they provide a systematic methodology for training\nneuromorphic computing hardware. Thus, they open a new avenue for a widespread\nadoption of SNNs in practical applications.",

A research framework and three novel\nindicators, Average Time Interval (ATI), Innovation Speed (IS) and Update Speed\n(US), are proposed to measure the pace of innovations in the field of AI. The\nresults show that: (1) in 2019, more than 3 AI preprints were submitted to\narXiv per hour, over 148 times faster than in 1994. Furthermore, there was one\ndeep learning-related preprint submitted to arXiv every 0.87 hours in 2019,\nover 1,064 times faster than in 1994. (2) For AI players, 5.26 new researchers\nentered into the field of AI each hour in 2019, more than 175 times faster than\nin the 1990s. (3) As for AI updates (trial and error), one updated AI preprint\nwas submitted to arXiv every 41 days, with around 33% of AI preprints having\nbeen updated at least twice in 2019. In addition, as reported in 2019, it took,\non average, only around 0.2 year for AI preprints to receive their first\ncitations, which is 5 times faster than 2000-2007. This swift pace in AI\nillustrates the increase in popularity of AI innovation. The systematic and\nfine-grained analysis of the AI field enabled to portrait the pace of AI\ninnovation and demonstrated that the proposed approach can be adopted to\nunderstand other fast-growing fields such as cancer research and nano science.",

      "abstract": "Signal capture stands in the forefront to perceive and understand the\nenvironment and thus imaging plays the pivotal role in mobile vision. Recent\nexplosive progresses in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown great potential\nto develop advanced mobile platforms with new imaging devices. Traditional\nimaging systems based on the \"capturing images first and processing afterwards\"\nmechanism cannot meet this unprecedented demand. Differently, Computational\nImaging (CI) systems are designed to capture high-dimensional data in an\nencoded manner to provide more information for mobile vision systems.Thanks to\nAI, CI can now be used in real systems by integrating deep learning algorithms\ninto the mobile vision platform to achieve the closed loop of intelligent\nacquisition, processing and decision making, thus leading to the next\nrevolution of mobile vision.Starting from the history of mobile vision using\ndigital cameras, this work first introduces the advances of CI in diverse\napplications and then conducts a comprehensive review of current research\ntopics combining CI and AI. Motivated by the fact that most existing studies\nonly loosely connect CI and AI (usually using AI to improve the performance of\nCI and only limited works have deeply connected them), in this work, we propose\na framework to deeply integrate CI and AI by using the example of self-driving\nvehicles with high-speed communication, edge computing and traffic planning.\nFinally, we outlook the future of CI plus AI by investigating new materials,\nbrain science and new computing techniques to shed light on new directions of\nmobile vision systems.",

      "abstract": "This study presents an explainable artificial intelligent (XAI) model for\npredicting pile driving vibrations in Bangkok's soft clay subsoil. A deep\nneural network was developed using a dataset of 1,018 real-world pile driving\nmeasurements, encompassing variations in pile dimensions, hammer\ncharacteristics, sensor locations, and vibration measurement axes. The model\nachieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.276, outperforming traditional\nempirical methods and other machine learning approaches such as XGBoost and\nCatBoost. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to\ninterpret the model's predictions, revealing complex relationships between\ninput features and peak particle velocity (PPV). Distance from the pile driving\nlocation emerged as the most influential factor, followed by hammer weight and\npile size. Non-linear relationships and threshold effects were observed,\nproviding new insights into vibration propagation in soft clay. A web-based\napplication was developed to facilitate adoption by practicing engineers,\nbridging the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and practical\nengineering applications. This research contributes to the field of\ngeotechnical engineering by offering a more accurate and nuanced approach to\npredicting pile driving vibrations, with implications for optimizing\nconstruction practices and mitigating environmental impacts in urban areas.

The goal of this paper is two-fold.\nFirst, we provide a qualified defence of the value of less data within the\ncontext of AI. This is done by carefully reviewing two distinct problems for\nbig data driven AI, namely a) the limited track record of Deep Learning in key\nareas such as Natural Language Processing, b) the regulatory and business\nsignificance of being able to learn from few data points. Second, we briefly\nsketch what we refer to as a case of AI with humans and for humans, namely an\nAI paradigm whereby the systems we build are privacy-oriented and focused on\nhuman-machine collaboration, not competition. Combining our claims above, we\nconclude that when seen through the lens of cognitively inspired AI, the bright\nfuture of the discipline is about less data, not more, and more humans, not\nfewer.",

This study proposes an innovative hybrid artificial\nintelligence (AI) system for automatic interpretation of EEG background\nactivity and report generation. The system combines deep learning models for\nposterior dominant rhythm (PDR) prediction, unsupervised artifact removal, and\nexpert-designed algorithms for abnormality detection. For PDR prediction, 1530\nlabeled EEGs were used, and the best ensemble model achieved a mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of 0.237, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.359, an accuracy of\n91.8% within a 0.6Hz error, and an accuracy of 99% within a 1.2Hz error. The AI\nsystem significantly outperformed neurologists in detecting generalized\nbackground slowing (p = 0.02; F1: AI 0.93, neurologists 0.82) and demonstrated\nimproved focal abnormality detection, although not statistically significant (p\n= 0.79; F1: AI 0.71, neurologists 0.55). Validation on both an internal dataset\nand the Temple University Abnormal EEG Corpus showed consistent performance\n(F1: 0.884 and 0.835, respectively; p = 0.66), demonstrating generalizability.\nThe use of large language models (LLMs) for report generation demonstrated 100%\naccuracy, verified by three other independent LLMs. This hybrid AI system\nprovides an easily scalable and accurate solution for EEG interpretation in\nresource-limited settings, assisting neurologists in improving diagnostic\naccuracy and reducing misdiagnosis rates.",

Guided by this theory, we have\nsuccessfully trained deep ReLU FNNs whose test results justify our developed\ntheory.

We identified common and diverging views about the\nchallenges and the needs faced by educational technologies experts in practice,\nthat lead the community to have a clear understanding on the main questions\nraising doubts in this topic. Based on these findings, we highlighted\ndirections that will facilitate the ongoing research towards fairer AI for\neducation.",

To address these concerns, we introduce the Model Openness\nFramework (MOF), a three-tiered ranked classification system that rates machine\nlearning models based on their completeness and openness, following open\nscience principles. For each MOF class, we specify code, data, and\ndocumentation components of the model development lifecycle that must be\nreleased and under which open licenses. In addition, the Model Openness Tool\n(MOT) provides a user-friendly reference implementation to evaluate the\nopenness and completeness of models against the MOF classification system.\nTogether, the MOF and MOT provide timely practical guidance for (i) model\nproducers to enhance the openness and completeness of their publicly-released\nmodels, and (ii) model consumers to identify open models and their constituent\ncomponents that can be permissively used, studied, modified, and redistributed.\nThrough the MOF, we seek to establish completeness and openness as core tenets\nof responsible AI research and development, and to promote best practices in\nthe burgeoning open AI ecosystem.",

Results are promising, especially for hybrid predictions that combine\nthe AI, which can reveal and exploit unknown spatio-temporal connections from\ndata, and climate models, that provide the theoretical foundation and\ninterpretability of the physical world. On the other hand, challenges are\nmultiple in many aspects, from data curation to model uncertainty and\ngeneralizability, to the reproducibility of methods and workflows. A few best\npractices are identified to increase trust in these novel techniques, and\nfuture perspectives are envisaged for further scientific development.",

Currently, labor-intensive\nmanual scoring methods are used for this purpose, but they are subjective and\ndo not scale for the emerging large-scale archival collections of human\ndecomposition photos. This study explores the feasibility of automating two\ncommon human decomposition scoring methods proposed by Megyesi and Gelderman\nusing artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluated two popular deep learning\nmodels, Inception V3 and Xception, by training them on a large dataset of human\ndecomposition images to classify the SOD for different anatomical regions,\nincluding the head, torso, and limbs. Additionally, an interrater study was\nconducted to assess the reliability of the AI models compared to human forensic\nexaminers for SOD identification. The Xception model achieved the best\nclassification performance, with macro-averaged F1 scores of .878, .881, and\n.702 for the head, torso, and limbs when predicting Megyesi's SODs, and .872,\n.875, and .76 for the head, torso, and limbs when predicting Gelderman's SODs.\nThe interrater study results supported AI's ability to determine the SOD at a\nreliability level comparable to a human expert.

The advent of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) is bringing in a personal choice revolution, wherein\nAI-driven individual decisions transform food systems from dinner tables, to\nthe farms, and back to our plates. In this context, AI algorithms refine\npersonal dietary choices, subsequently shaping agricultural outputs, and\npromoting an optimized feedback loop from consumption to cultivation.\nInitially, we delve into AI tools and techniques spanning the food supply\nchain, and subsequently assess how AI subfields$\\unicode{x2013}$encompassing\nmachine learning, computer vision, and speech recognition$\\unicode{x2013}$are\nharnessed within the AI-enabled Food System (AIFS) framework, which\nincreasingly leverages Internet of Things, multimodal sensors and real-time\ndata exchange. We spotlight the AIFS framework, emphasizing its fusion of AI\nwith technologies such as digitalization, big data analytics, biotechnology,\nand IoT extensively used in modern food systems in every component. This\nparadigm shifts the conventional \"farm to fork\" narrative to a cyclical\n\"consumer-driven farm to fork\" model for better achieving sustainable,\nnutritious diets. This paper explores AI's promise and the intrinsic challenges\nit poses within the food domain. By championing stringent AI governance,\nuniform data architectures, and cross-disciplinary partnerships, we argue that\nAI, when synergized with consumer-centric strategies, holds the potential to\nsteer food systems toward a sustainable trajectory. We furnish a comprehensive\nsurvey for the state-of-the-art in diverse facets of food systems, subsequently\npinpointing gaps and advocating for the judicious and efficacious deployment of\nemergent AI methodologies.",

The\nmost significant change is a huge increase in the maximum fine that can be\nlevied for breaches of the regulation. Yet fewer than half of UK companies are\nfully aware of GDPR - and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped\ndoing so when the Brexit vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become\ncompliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer\nadvice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an\nenvironment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by\nproviding best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring\nactivities; and carrying out assessments. The paper considers four areas of\nGDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning\ntechniques may be relevant: * Following compliance checklists and codes of\nconduct; * Supporting risk assessments; * Complying with the new regulations\nregarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; * Complying with the\nnew regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It\nconcludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The\nrequirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state\nfor explanation and justification of reasoning imply that rule-based approaches\nare likely to be more helpful than machine learning approaches.

      "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death\nglobally. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods - in particular, deep\nlearning (DL) - has been on the rise lately for the analysis of different\nCVD-related topics. The use of fundus images and optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) in the diagnosis of retinal diseases has also been\nextensively studied. To better understand heart function and anticipate changes\nbased on microvascular characteristics and function, researchers are currently\nexploring the integration of AI with non-invasive retinal scanning. There is\ngreat potential to reduce the number of cardiovascular events and the financial\nstrain on healthcare systems by utilizing AI-assisted early detection and\nprediction of cardiovascular diseases on a large scale. Method: A comprehensive\nsearch was conducted across various databases, including PubMed, Medline,\nGoogle Scholar, Scopus, Web of Sciences, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library,\nusing specific keywords related to cardiovascular diseases and artificial\nintelligence. Results: The study included 87 English-language publications\nselected for relevance, and additional references were considered. This paper\nprovides an overview of the recent developments and difficulties in using\nartificial intelligence and retinal imaging to diagnose cardiovascular\ndiseases. It provides insights for further exploration in this field.\nConclusion: Researchers are trying to develop precise disease prognosis\npatterns in response to the aging population and the growing global burden of\nCVD. AI and deep learning are revolutionizing healthcare by potentially\ndiagnosing multiple CVDs from a single retinal image. However, swifter adoption\nof these technologies in healthcare systems is required.",

After\npre-training, VisionFM provides a foundation to foster multiple ophthalmic\nartificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as disease screening and\ndiagnosis, disease prognosis, subclassification of disease phenotype, and\nsystemic biomarker and disease prediction, with each application enhanced with\nexpert-level intelligence and accuracy. The generalist intelligence of VisionFM\noutperformed ophthalmologists with basic and intermediate levels in jointly\ndiagnosing 12 common ophthalmic diseases. Evaluated on a new large-scale\nophthalmic disease diagnosis benchmark database, as well as a new large-scale\nsegmentation and detection benchmark database, VisionFM outperformed strong\nbaseline deep neural networks. The ophthalmic image representations learned by\nVisionFM exhibited noteworthy explainability, and demonstrated strong\ngeneralizability to new ophthalmic modalities, disease spectrum, and imaging\ndevices. As a foundation model, VisionFM has a large capacity to learn from\ndiverse ophthalmic imaging data and disparate datasets. To be commensurate with\nthis capacity, in addition to the real data used for pre-training, we also\ngenerated and leveraged synthetic ophthalmic imaging data. Experimental results\nrevealed that synthetic data that passed visual Turing tests, can also enhance\nthe representation learning capability of VisionFM, leading to substantial\nperformance gains on downstream ophthalmic AI tasks. Beyond the ophthalmic AI\napplications developed, validated, and demonstrated in this work, substantial\nfurther applications can be achieved in an efficient and cost-effective manner\nusing VisionFM as the foundation.",

It was found that the\nfocus of current research is the assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained\ntissue sections of adult-type diffuse gliomas. The majority of studies (52/83)\nare based on the publicly available glioblastoma and low-grade glioma datasets\nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and only a few studies employed other\ndatasets in isolation (16/83) or in addition to the TCGA datasets (15/83).\nCurrent approaches mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (63/83) for\nanalyzing tissue at 20x magnification (35/83). A new field of research is the\nintegration of clinical data, omics data, or magnetic resonance imaging\n(29/83).

We explored the characteristics of the data used in\nthe surveyed articles and assessed the practical implications of the research\npresented there. Most of the research focuses on the blast furnace or hot\nrolling, using data from industrial sensors. Current trends show increasing\ninterest in the domain, especially in the use of deep learning. The main\nchallenges include implementing the proposed methods in a production\nenvironment, incorporating them into maintenance plans, and enhancing the\naccessibility and reproducibility of the research.",

Accurately forecasting these\nevents and their impact on Earth's magnetosphere remains a challenge because of\nthe complexity of solar-terrestrial interactions. This study applied artificial\nintelligence (AI) to predict the chain of events associated with the May $2024$\nsuperstorm, including solar flares from NOAA active region 13644,\nEarth-directed CMEs, and a violent geomagnetic storm. Using magnetogram\ncut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active\nregion morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the\noccurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of\nCME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind\nmeasurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to\nsound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed\nunprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as\none minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in\npredicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the\ngeomagnetic storm.

The need for\nincreased explainability to enable trust is critical for 6G as it manages a\nwide range of mission critical services (e.g. autonomous driving) to safety\ncritical tasks (e.g. remote surgery).

      "abstract": "Histopathological image analysis is crucial for accurate cancer diagnosis and\ntreatment planning. While deep learning models, especially convolutional neural\nnetworks, have advanced this field, their \"black-box\" nature raises concerns\nabout interpretability and trustworthiness. Explainable Artificial Intelligence\n(XAI) techniques aim to address these concerns, but evaluating their\neffectiveness remains challenging. A significant issue with current\nocclusion-based XAI methods is that they often generate Out-of-Distribution\n(OoD) samples, leading to inaccurate evaluations. In this paper, we introduce\nInpainting-Based Occlusion (IBO), a novel occlusion strategy that utilizes a\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model to inpaint occluded regions in\nhistopathological images. By replacing cancerous areas with realistic,\nnon-cancerous tissue, IBO minimizes OoD artifacts and preserves data integrity.\nWe evaluate our method on the CAMELYON16 dataset through two phases: first, by\nassessing perceptual similarity using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch\nSimilarity (LPIPS) metric, and second, by quantifying the impact on model\npredictions through Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis. Our results\ndemonstrate that IBO significantly improves perceptual fidelity, achieving\nnearly twice the improvement in LPIPS scores compared to the best existing\nocclusion strategy. Additionally, IBO increased the precision of XAI\nperformance prediction from 42% to 71% compared to traditional methods. These\nresults demonstrate IBO's potential to provide more reliable evaluations of XAI\ntechniques, benefiting histopathology and other applications.

However, for most scientific problems, the use of deep\nlearning is not appropriate as the amount of available data is limited, and/or\nthe output models must be explainable. Nevertheless, many scientific problems\ndo have significant amounts of data available on related tasks, which makes\nthem amenable to multi-task learning, i.e. learning many related problems\nsimultaneously. Here we propose a novel and general representation learning\napproach for multi-task learning that works successfully with small amounts of\ndata. The fundamental new idea is to transform an input intrinsic data\nrepresentation (i.e., handcrafted features), to an extrinsic representation\nbased on what a pre-trained set of models predict about the examples. This\ntransformation has the dual advantages of producing significantly more accurate\npredictions, and providing explainable models. To demonstrate the utility of\nthis transformative learning approach, we have applied it to three real-world\nscientific problems: drug-design (quantitative structure activity relationship\nlearning), predicting human gene expression (across different tissue types and\ndrug treatments), and meta-learning for machine learning (predicting which\nmachine learning methods work best for a given problem). In all three problems,\ntransformative machine learning significantly outperforms the best intrinsic\nrepresentation.",

However, due to the directional nature and the\nline-of-sight demand of THz links, as well as the ultra-dense deployment of THz\nnetworks, a number of challenges that the medium access control (MAC) layer\nneeds to face are created. In more detail, the need of rethinking user\nassociation and resource allocation strategies by incorporating artificial\nintelligence (AI) capable of providing \"real-time\" solutions in complex and\nfrequently changing environments becomes evident. Moreover, to satisfy the\nultra-reliability and low-latency demands of several B5G applications, novel\nmobility management approaches are required. Motivated by this, this article\npresents a holistic MAC layer approach that enables intelligent user\nassociation and resource allocation, as well as flexible and adaptive mobility\nmanagement, while maximizing systems' reliability through blockage\nminimization. In more detail, a fast and centralized joint user association,\nradio resource allocation, and blockage avoidance by means of a novel\nmetaheuristic-machine learning framework is documented, that maximizes the THz\nnetworks performance, while minimizing the association latency by approximately\nthree orders of magnitude. To support, within the access point (AP) coverage\narea, mobility management and blockage avoidance, a deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) approach for beam-selection is discussed. Finally, to support user\nmobility between coverage areas of neighbor APs, a proactive hand-over\nmechanism based on AI-assisted fast channel prediction is~reported.",

The respective machine learning\nmethods are based on neurological concepts so that they can systematically\nderive knowledge from data and store it. One type of machine learning\nalgorithms that can be categorized as \"deep learning\" model is referred to as\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs). DNNs consist of multiple artificial neurons\narranged in layers that are trained by using the backpropagation algorithm.\nThese deep learning methods exhibit amazing capabilities for inferring and\nstoring complex knowledge from high-dimensional data. However, DNNs are\naffected by a problem that prevents new knowledge from being added to an\nexisting base. The ability to continuously accumulate knowledge is an important\nfactor that contributed to evolution and is therefore a prerequisite for the\ndevelopment of strong AIs. The so-called \"catastrophic forgetting\" (CF) effect\ncauses DNNs to immediately loose already derived knowledge after a few training\niterations on a new data distribution.

However, the major disadvantage of\nneural networks remains: their numerous parameters are challenging to interpret\nand explain. Thus, neural networks are often labeled as black boxes, and their\nresults often elude human interpretation. In mechanics, the new and active\nfield of physics-informed neural networks attempts to mitigate this\ndisadvantage by designing deep neural networks on the basis of mechanical\nknowledge. By using this a priori knowledge, deeper and more complex neural\nnetworks became feasible, since the mechanical assumptions could be explained.\nHowever, the internal reasoning and explanation of neural network parameters\nremain mysterious.\n  Complementary to the physics-informed approach, we propose a first step\ntowards a physics-informing approach, which explains neural networks trained on\nmechanical data a posteriori. This novel explainable artificial intelligence\napproach aims at elucidating the black box of neural networks and their\nhigh-dimensional representations. Therein, the principal component analysis\ndecorrelates the distributed representations in cell states of RNNs and allows\nthe comparison to known and fundamental functions. The novel approach is\nsupported by a systematic hyperparameter search strategy that identifies the\nbest neural network architectures and training parameters. The findings of\nthree case studies on fundamental constitutive models (hyperelasticity,\nelastoplasticity, and viscoelasticity) imply that the proposed strategy can\nhelp identify numerical and analytical closed-form solutions to characterize\nnew materials.",

It motivates XR-AI combinations as\na method to learn about the effects of prospective human-AI interfaces and\nshows why the combination of XR and AI fruitfully contributes to a valid and\nsystematic investigation of human-AI interactions and interfaces.

In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting\ndecision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process.

Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that,\nreveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting\noptimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the\nmedical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D)\nultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size\nand number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image\nanalysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced\nimage analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging\nmodalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper\ninsights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises\nconcerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key\nfactors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on\nsingle-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of\ntheir findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced\nimaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the\nimportance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets.\nAddressing these gaps has the potential to enhance ovarian stimulation\nmanagement, paving the way for efficient, personalized, and data-driven\ntreatment pathways that improve IVF outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in critical\ncontexts, such as medicine, requires the implementation of safety measures to\nreduce risks of harm in case of prediction errors. Spotting ML failures is of\nparamount importance when ML predictions are used to drive clinical decisions.\nML predictive reliability measures the degree of trust of a ML prediction on a\nnew instance, thus allowing decision-makers to accept or reject it based on its\nreliability. To assess reliability, we propose a method that implements two\nprinciples. First, our approach evaluates whether an instance to be classified\nis coming from the same distribution of the training set. To do this, we\nleverage Autoencoders (AEs) ability to reconstruct the training set with low\nerror. An instance is considered Out-of-Distribution (OOD) if the AE\nreconstructs it with a high error. Second, it is evaluated whether the ML\nclassifier has good performances on samples similar to the newly classified\ninstance by using a proxy model. We show that this approach is able to assess\nreliability both in a simulated scenario and on a model trained to predict\ndisease progression of Multiple Sclerosis patients. We also developed a Python\npackage, named relAI, to embed reliability measures into ML pipelines. We\npropose a simple approach that can be used in the deployment phase of any ML\nmodel to suggest whether to trust predictions or not. Our method holds the\npromise to provide effective support to clinicians by spotting potential ML\nfailures during deployment.",

An effective testing\nstrategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for\ntesting surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to\nscreen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only\nseconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a\ndataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution\nneural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet,\nInceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models,\nwe then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen\nCOVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A\nfeature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are\nimportant for classification.

In recent years, several approaches have\nbeen made to improve and automate the procedure using artificial intelligence\n(AI) and deep learning. Based on images of embryos with known implantation data\n(KID), AI models have been trained to automatically score embryos related to\ntheir chance of achieving a successful implantation. However, as of now, only\nlimited research has been conducted to evaluate how embryo selection models\ngeneralize to new clinics and how they perform in subgroup analyses across\nvarious conditions. In this paper, we investigate how a deep learning-based\nembryo selection model using only time-lapse image sequences performs across\ndifferent patient ages and clinical conditions, and how it correlates with\ntraditional morphokinetic parameters. The model was trained and evaluated based\non a large dataset from 18 IVF centers consisting of 115,832 embryos, of which\n14,644 embryos were transferred KID embryos. In an independent test set, the AI\nmodel sorted KID embryos with an area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver\noperating characteristic curve of 0.67 and all embryos with an AUC of 0.95. A\nclinic hold-out test showed that the model generalized to new clinics with an\nAUC range of 0.60-0.75 for KID embryos. Across different subgroups of age,\ninsemination method, incubation time, and transfer protocol, the AUC ranged\nbetween 0.63 and 0.69. Furthermore, model predictions correlated positively\nwith blastocyst grading and negatively with direct cleavages. The fully\nautomated iDAScore v1.0 model was shown to perform at least as good as a\nstate-of-the-art manual embryo selection model. Moreover, full automatization\nof embryo scoring implies fewer manual evaluations and eliminates biases due to\ninter- and intraobserver variation.",

This Review consolidates\nrecent methodological advances in computational pathology for predicting\nclinical end points in whole-slide images and highlights how these developments\nenable the automation of clinical practice and the discovery of new biomarkers.\nWe then provide future perspectives as the field expands into a broader range\nof clinical and research tasks with increasingly diverse modalities of clinical\ndata.",

In this paper, we propose improved Transformer\nand conditional generative adversarial neural networks (CGAN) for the inverse\ndesign of graphene metasurfaces based upon THz multi-resonant absorption\nspectra. The improved Transformer can obtain higher accuracy and generalization\nperformance in the StoV (Spectrum to Vector) design compared to traditional\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, while the StoI (Spectrum to Image)\ndesign achieved through CGAN can provide more comprehensive information and\nhigher accuracy than the StoV design obtained by MLP. Moreover, the improved\nCGAN can achieve the inverse design of graphene metasurface images directly\nfrom the desired multi-resonant absorption spectra. It is turned out that this\nwork can finish facilitating the design process of artificial\nintelligence-generated metasurfaces (AIGM), and even provide a useful guide for\ndeveloping complex THz metasurfaces based on 2D materials using generative\nneural networks.",

It was perhaps inevitable that COVID-19, a global\ndisease propagating health and economic devastation, should capture the\nattention and resources of the world's computer scientists in academia and\nindustry. The potential for AI to support the response to the pandemic has been\nproposed across a wide range of clinical and societal challenges, including\ndisease forecasting, surveillance and antiviral drug discovery. This is likely\nto continue as the impact of the pandemic unfolds on the world's people,\nindustries and economy but a surprising observation on the current pandemic has\nbeen the limited impact AI has had to date in the management of COVID-19. This\ncorrespondence focuses on exploring potential reasons behind the lack of\nsuccessful adoption of AI models developed for COVID-19 diagnosis and\nprognosis, in front-line healthcare services. We highlight the moving clinical\nneeds that models have had to address at different stages of the epidemic, and\nexplain the importance of translating models to reflect local healthcare\nenvironments. We argue that both basic and applied research are essential to\naccelerate the potential of AI models, and this is particularly so during a\nrapidly evolving pandemic.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made great strides since the deep learning\nrevolution, but AI systems still struggle to extrapolate outside of their\ntraining data and adapt to new situations. For inspiration we look to the\ndomain of science, where scientists have been able to develop theories which\nshow remarkable ability to extrapolate and sometimes predict the existence of\nphenomena which have never been observed before. According to David Deutsch,\nthis type of extrapolation, which he calls \"reach\", is due to scientific\ntheories being hard to vary. In this work we investigate Deutsch's hard-to-vary\nprinciple and how it relates to more formalized principles in deep learning\nsuch as the bias-variance trade-off and Occam's razor. We distinguish internal\nvariability, how much a model/theory can be varied internally while still\nyielding the same predictions, with external variability, which is how much a\nmodel must be varied to accurately predict new, out-of-distribution data. We\ndiscuss how to measure internal variability using the size of the Rashomon set\nand how to measure external variability using Kolmogorov complexity. We explore\nwhat role hard-to-vary explanations play in intelligence by looking at the\nhuman brain and distinguish two learning systems in the brain. The first system\noperates similar to deep learning and likely underlies most of perception and\nmotor control while the second is a more creative system capable of generating\nhard-to-vary explanations of the world. We argue that figuring out how\nreplicate this second system, which is capable of generating hard-to-vary\nexplanations, is a key challenge which needs to be solved in order to realize\nartificial general intelligence.

The performances of these metaheuristic methods in optimizing CNN\non classifying MNIST and CIFAR dataset were evaluated and compared.\nFurthermore, the proposed methods are also compared with the original CNN.\nAlthough the proposed methods show an increase in the computation time, their\naccuracy has also been improved (up to 7.14 percent).",

The visual explanations were provided\non in-vivo gastral images obtained from a Video capsule endoscopy (VCE), with\nthe goal of increasing the health professionals' trust in the black box\npredictions. We implemented two post-hoc interpretable machine learning methods\nLIME and SHAP and the alternative explanation approach CIU, centered on the\nContextual Value and Utility (CIU). The produced explanations were evaluated\nusing human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on the\nexplanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical\nbackgrounds carried out a series of tests in the web-based survey setting and\nstated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user\ngroups (n=20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were\nquantitatively analyzed. We have found that, as hypothesized, the CIU\nexplainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of\nincreasing support for human decision-making as well as being more transparent\nand thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP\nby generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are\nnotable differences in human decision-making between various explanation\nsupport settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable\nmethods that can with future improvements in implementation be generalized on\ndifferent medical data sets and can provide great decision-support for medical\nexperts.",

Systematic exploitation of the big data greatly helps in making\nthe network smart, intelligent and facilitates cost-effective operation and\noptimization. In view of this, we consider a data-driven next-generation\nwireless network model, where the MNOs employ advanced data analytics for their\nnetworks. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of\nthe data analytics and the role of machine learning, artificial intelligence in\nmaking the network intelligent in terms of being self-aware, self-adaptive,\nproactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes\nare presented with respect to data analytics. The paper is concluded with a\ndiscussion of challenges and benefits of adopting big data analytics and\nartificial intelligence in the next-generation communication system.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel framework for guaranteeing ultra-reliable millimeter\nwave (mmW) communications using multiple artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is proposed. The use of multiple\nAI-powered RISs allows changing the propagation direction of the signals\ntransmitted from a mmW access point (AP) thereby improving coverage\nparticularly for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. However, due to the\npossibility of highly stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an\nintelligent controller to jointly optimize the mmW AP beam and RIS phase shifts\nis a daunting task. In this regard, first, a parametric risk-sensitive episodic\nreturn is proposed to maximize the expected bit rate and mitigate the risk of\nmmW link blockage. Then, a closed-form approximation of the policy gradient of\nthe risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. Next, the problem\nof joint beamforming for mmW AP and phase shift control for mmW RISs is modeled\nas an identical payoff stochastic game within a cooperative multi-agent\nenvironment, in which the agents are the mmW AP and the RISs. Two centralized\nand distributed controllers are proposed to control the policies of the mmW AP\nand RISs. To directly find an optimal solution, the parametric functional-form\npolicies for these controllers are modeled using deep recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs). Simulation results show that the error between policies of the optimal\nand the RNN-based controllers is less than 1.5%. Moreover, the variance of the\nachievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based controllers is 60% less than\nthe variance of the risk-averse baseline.",

These systems rely on maximum likelihood point\nestimates of their parameters, precluding them from expressing model\nuncertainty. This may result in overconfident predictions and it prevents the\nuse of deep learning models for sequential decision making. This thesis\ndevelops scalable methods to equip neural networks with model uncertainty. In\nparticular, we leverage the linearised Laplace approximation to equip\npre-trained neural networks with the uncertainty estimates provided by their\ntangent linear models. This turns the problem of Bayesian inference in neural\nnetworks into one of Bayesian inference in conjugate Gaussian-linear models.\nAlas, the cost of this remains cubic in either the number of network parameters\nor in the number of observations times output dimensions. By assumption,\nneither are tractable. We address this intractability by using stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) -- the workhorse algorithm of deep learning -- to\nperform posterior sampling in linear models and their convex duals: Gaussian\nprocesses. With this, we turn back to linearised neural networks, finding the\nlinearised Laplace approximation to present a number of incompatibilities with\nmodern deep learning practices -- namely, stochastic optimisation, early\nstopping and normalisation layers -- when used for hyperparameter learning. We\nresolve these and construct a sample-based EM algorithm for scalable\nhyperparameter learning with linearised neural networks. We apply the above\nmethods to perform linearised neural network inference with ResNet-50 (25M\nparameters) trained on Imagenet (1.2M observations and 1000 output dimensions).\nAdditionally, we apply our methods to estimate uncertainty for 3d tomographic\nreconstructions obtained with the deep image prior network.",

With parameter sharing mechanism, the unrolled Factor\nGraph Neural Network model can be trained with stochastic depth and generalize\nwell.

      "abstract": "Scientific machine learning (SciML) is an interdisciplinary research field\nthat integrates machine learning, particularly deep learning, with physics\ntheory to understand and predict complex natural phenomena. By incorporating\nphysical knowledge, SciML reduces the dependency on observational data, which\nis often limited in the natural sciences. In this article, the fundamental\nconcepts of SciML, its applications in seismology, and prospects are described.\nSpecifically, two popular methods are mainly discussed: physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). PINNs can address both forward and\ninverse problems by incorporating governing laws into the loss functions. The\nuse of PINNs is expanding into areas such as simultaneous solutions of\ndifferential equations, inference in underdetermined systems, and\nregularization based on physics. These research directions would broaden the\nscope of deep learning in natural sciences. NOs are models designed for\noperator learning, which deals with relationships between infinite-dimensional\nspaces. NOs show promise in modeling the time evolution of complex systems\nbased on observational or simulation data. Since large amounts of data are\noften required, combining NOs with physics-informed learning holds significant\npotential. Finally, SciML is considered from a broader perspective beyond deep\nlearning: statistical (or mathematical) frameworks that integrate observational\ndata with physical principles to model natural phenomena. In seismology,\nmathematically rigorous Bayesian statistics has been developed over the past\ndecades, whereas more flexible and scalable deep learning has only emerged\nrecently. Both approaches can be considered as part of SciML in a broad sense.\nTheoretical and practical insights in both directions would advance SciML\nmethodologies and thereby deepen our understanding of earthquake phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Rural electrification demands the use of inexpensive technologies such as\nsingle wire earth return (SWER) networks. There is a steadily growing energy\ndemand from remote consumers, and the capacity of existing lines may become\ninadequate soon. Furthermore, high impedance arcing faults (HIF) from SWER\nlines can cause catastrophic bushfires such as the 2009 Black Saturday event.\nAs a solution, reliable remote electricity networks can be established through\nbreaking the existing systems down into microgrids, and existing SWER lines can\nbe utilised to interconnect those microgrids. The development of such reliable\nnetworks with better energy demand management will rely on having an integrated\nnetwork-wide condition monitoring system. As the first contribution of this\nthesis, a distributed online monitoring platform is developed that incorporates\npower quality monitoring, real-time HIF identification and transient\nclassification in SWER network. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques\nare developed to classify faults and transients. The proposed approach\ndemonstrates higher HIF detection accuracy (98.67%) and reduced detection\nlatency (115.2 ms). Secondly, a remote consumer load identification methodology\nis developed to detect the load type from its transients. An edge\ncomputing-based architecture is proposed to facilitate the high-frequency\nanalysis for load identification. The proposed approach is evaluated in\nreal-time, and it achieves an average accuracy of 98% in identifying different\nloads. Finally, a deep neural network-based energy disaggregation framework is\ndeveloped to separate the load specific energy usage from an aggregated signal.\nThe proposed framework is evaluated using a real-world data set. It improves\nthe signal aggregate error by 44% and mean aggregate error by 19% in comparison\nwith the state-of-the-art techniques.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has\nsparked tremendous global interest. DL is widely used today and has expanded\ninto various interesting areas. It is becoming more popular in cross-subject\nresearch, such as studies of smart city systems, which combine computer science\nwith engineering applications. Human action detection is one of these areas.\nHuman action detection is an interesting challenge due to its stringent\nrequirements in terms of computing speed and accuracy. High-accuracy real-time\nobject tracking is also considered a significant challenge. This paper\nintegrates the YOLO detection network, which is considered a state-of-the-art\ntool for real-time object detection, with motion vectors and the Coyote\nOptimization Algorithm (COA) to construct a real-time human action localization\nand tracking system. The proposed system starts with the extraction of motion\ninformation from a compressed video stream and the extraction of appearance\ninformation from RGB frames using an object detector. Then, a fusion step\nbetween the two streams is performed, and the results are fed into the proposed\naction tracking model. The COA is used in object tracking due to its accuracy\nand fast convergence. The basic foundation of the proposed model is the\nutilization of motion vectors, which already exist in a compressed video bit\nstream and provide sufficient information to improve the localization of the\ntarget action without requiring high consumption of computational resources\ncompared with other popular methods of extracting motion information, such as\noptical flows. This advantage allows the proposed approach to be implemented in\nchallenging environments where the computational resources are limited, such as\nInternet of Things (IoT) systems.",

The\noccurrence of microbes and viruses, including the likes of HIV, plays a crucial\nrole in the development of myocarditis disease (MCD). The images produced\nduring cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) scans are low contrast, which\ncan make it challenging to diagnose cardiovascular diseases. In other hand,\nchecking numerous CMRI slices for each CVD patient can be a challenging task\nfor medical doctors. To overcome the existing challenges, researchers have\nsuggested the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided\ndiagnosis systems (CADS). The presented paper outlines a CADS for the detection\nof MCD from CMR images, utilizing deep learning (DL) methods. The proposed CADS\nconsists of several steps, including dataset, preprocessing, feature\nextraction, classification, and post-processing. First, the Z-Alizadeh dataset\nwas selected for the experiments. Subsequently, the CMR images underwent\nvarious preprocessing steps, including denoising, resizing, as well as data\naugmentation (DA) via CutMix and MixUp techniques. In the following, the most\ncurrent deep pre-trained and transformer models are used for feature extraction\nand classification on the CMR images. The findings of our study reveal that\ntransformer models exhibit superior performance in detecting MCD as opposed to\npre-trained architectures. In terms of DL architectures, the Turbulence Neural\nTransformer (TNT) model exhibited impressive accuracy, reaching 99.73%\nutilizing a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Additionally, to pinpoint areas\nof suspicion for MCD in CMRI images, the Explainable-based Grad Cam method was\nemployed.",

Our convolutional neural network is\ncapable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in noisy time-series data with a\ngreater accuracy than a least-squares method. Deep nets are highly\ngeneralizable allowing data to be evaluated from different time series after\ninterpolation without compromising performance. As validated by our deep net\nanalysis of Kepler light curves, we detect periodic transits consistent with\nthe true period without any model fitting.

Nevertheless, the\ndevelopment and use of AI-driven healthcare systems raise numerous ethical,\nlegal, and socio-economic issues. Justice is a major concern in AI that has\nimplications for amplifying social inequities. This paper discusses these\nimplications and related justice concepts such as solidarity, Common Good,\nsustainability, AI bias, and fairness. For Africa to effectively benefit from\nAI, these principles should align with the local context while balancing the\nrisks. Compared to mainstream ethical debates on justice, this perspective\noffers context-specific considerations for equitable healthcare AI development\nin Africa.",

      "abstract": "Climate change poses one of the most significant challenges to humanity. As a\nresult of these climatic changes, the frequency of weather, climate, and\nwater-related disasters has multiplied fivefold over the past 50 years,\nresulting in over 2 million deaths and losses exceeding $3.64 trillion USD.\nLeveraging AI-powered technologies for sustainable development and combating\nclimate change is a promising avenue. Numerous significant publications are\ndedicated to using AI to improve renewable energy forecasting, enhance waste\nmanagement, and monitor environmental changes in real time. However, very few\nresearch studies focus on making AI itself environmentally sustainable. This\noversight regarding the sustainability of AI within the field might be\nattributed to a mindset gap and the absence of comprehensive energy datasets.\nIn addition, with the ubiquity of edge AI systems and applications, especially\non-device learning, there is a pressing need to measure, analyze, and optimize\ntheir environmental sustainability, such as energy efficiency. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose large-scale energy datasets for edge AI, named\nDeepEn2023, covering a wide range of kernels, state-of-the-art deep neural\nnetwork models, and popular edge AI applications. We anticipate that DeepEn2023\nwill improve transparency in sustainability in on-device deep learning across a\nrange of edge AI systems and applications.

The learning algorithm trains a discrete field theory\nfrom a set of observational data on a spacetime lattice, and the serving\nalgorithm uses the learned discrete field theory to predict new observations of\nthe field for new boundary and initial conditions. The approach to learn\ndiscrete field theories overcomes the difficulties associated with learning\ncontinuous theories by artificial intelligence. The serving algorithm of\ndiscrete field theories belongs to the family of structure-preserving geometric\nalgorithms, which have been proven to be superior to the conventional\nalgorithms based on discretization of differential equations. The effectiveness\nof the method and algorithms developed is demonstrated using the examples of\nnonlinear oscillations and the Kepler problem. In particular, the learning\nalgorithm learns a discrete field theory from a set of data of planetary orbits\nsimilar to what Kepler inherited from Tycho Brahe in 1601, and the serving\nalgorithm correctly predicts other planetary orbits, including parabolic and\nhyperbolic escaping orbits, of the solar system without learning or knowing\nNewton's laws of motion and universal gravitation. The proposed algorithms are\nalso applicable when effects of special relativity and general relativity are\nimportant. The illustrated advantages of discrete field theories relative to\ncontinuous theories in terms of machine learning compatibility are consistent\nwith Bostrom's simulation hypothesis.",

We consider diversity in terms of gender, geographical location\nand business (understood as the presence of academia versus industry). We\ncompute these indicators for the different communities of a conference:\nauthors, keynote speakers and organizing committee. From these components we\ncompute a summarized diversity indicator for each AI event. We evaluate the\nproposed indexes for a set of recent major AI conferences and we discuss their\nvalues and limitations.",

We present an overview of the Act and\nanalyse its implications, drawing on scholarship ranging from the study of\ncontemporary AI practices to the structure of EU product safety regimes over\nthe last four decades. Aspects of the AI Act, such as different rules for\ndifferent risk-levels of AI, make sense. But we also find that some provisions\nof the Draft AI Act have surprising legal implications, whilst others may be\nlargely ineffective at achieving their stated goals. Several overarching\naspects, including the enforcement regime and the risks of maximum\nharmonisation pre-empting legitimate national AI policy, engender significant\nconcern.

We introduce an artificial\nintelligence (AI) model aiming to personalize treatment and improve outcomes,\nwhich was deployed in the Artificial Intelligence in Depression Medication\nEnhancement (AIDME) Study. OBJECTIVES: 1) Develop a model capable of predicting\nprobabilities of remission across multiple pharmacological treatments for\nadults with at least moderate major depression. 2) Validate model predictions\nand examine them for amplification of harmful biases. METHODS: Data from\nprevious clinical trials of antidepressant medications were standardized into a\ncommon framework and included 9,042 adults with moderate to severe major\ndepression. Feature selection retained 25 clinical and demographic variables.\nUsing Bayesian optimization, a deep learning model was trained on the training\nset, refined using the validation set, and tested once on the held-out test\nset. RESULTS: In the evaluation on the held-out test set, the model\ndemonstrated achieved an AUC of 0.65. The model outperformed a null model on\nthe test set (p = 0.01). The model demonstrated clinical utility, achieving an\nabsolute improvement in population remission rate in hypothetical and actual\nimprovement testing. While the model did identify one drug (escitalopram) as\ngenerally outperforming the other drugs (consistent with the input data), there\nwas otherwise significant variation in drug rankings. On bias testing, the\nmodel did not amplify potentially harmful biases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate\nthe first model capable of predicting outcomes for 10 different treatment\noptions for patients with MDD, intended to be used at or near the start of\ntreatment to personalize treatment. The model was put into clinical practice\nduring the AIDME randomized controlled trial whose results are reported\nseparately.",

      "abstract": "Bagging has achieved great success in the field of machine learning by\nintegrating multiple base classifiers to build a single strong classifier to\nreduce model variance. The performance improvement of bagging mainly relies on\nthe number and diversity of base classifiers. However, traditional deep\nlearning model training methods are expensive to train individually and\ndifficult to train multiple models with low similarity in a restricted dataset.\nRecently, diffusion models, which have been tremendously successful in the\nfields of imaging and vision, have been found to be effective in generating\nneural network model weights and biases with diversity. We creatively propose a\nBagging deep learning training algorithm based on Efficient Neural network\nDiffusion (BEND). The originality of BEND comes from the first use of a neural\nnetwork diffusion model to efficiently build base classifiers for bagging. Our\napproach is simple but effective, first using multiple trained model weights\nand biases as inputs to train autoencoder and latent diffusion model to realize\na diffusion model from noise to valid neural network parameters. Subsequently,\nwe generate several base classifiers using the trained diffusion model.\nFinally, we integrate these ba se classifiers for various inference tasks using\nthe Bagging method. Resulting experiments on multiple models and datasets show\nthat our proposed BEND algorithm can consistently outperform the mean and\nmedian accuracies of both the original trained model and the diffused model. At\nthe same time, new models diffused using the diffusion model have higher\ndiversity and lower cost than multiple models trained using traditional\nmethods. The BEND approach successfully introduces diffusion models into the\nnew deep learning training domain and provides a new paradigm for future deep\nlearning training and inference.",

In a series of\npapers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete\nmathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and\nrigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing\nintelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the\nphilosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of\nrational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.\nRecently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally\ninvestigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough\nhas resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique\nthat UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain\nknowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of\ninteractive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to\nplay TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without\neven providing the rules of the games.\n  These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General\nIntelligence is not elusive.\n  This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context.

Various alignment-based, signal-based and content-based approaches are\nreported for the prediction of promoters. However, since all promoter sequences\ndo not show explicit features, the prediction performance of these techniques\nis poor. Therefore, many machine learning and deep learning models have been\nproposed for promoter prediction. In this work, we studied methods for vector\nencoding and promoter classification using genome sequences of three distinct\nhigher eukaryotes viz. yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), A. thaliana (plant)\nand human (Homo sapiens). We compared one-hot vector encoding method with\nfrequency-based tokenization (FBT) for data pre-processing on 1-D Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) model. We found that FBT gives a shorter input dimension\nreducing the training time without affecting the sensitivity and specificity of\nclassification. We employed the deep learning techniques, mainly CNN and\nrecurrent neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and random forest\n(RF) classifier for promoter classification at k-mer sizes of 2, 4 and 8. We\nfound CNN to be superior in classification of promoters from non-promoter\nsequences (binary classification) as well as species-specific classification of\npromoter sequences (multiclass classification). In summary, the contribution of\nthis work lies in the use of synthetic shuffled negative dataset and\nfrequency-based tokenization for pre-processing.

More concisely, we combine a so-called\nconvolutional neural network for image recognition with graphs that in a\npairwise manner plot the normalized bid values of some reference firm against\nthe normalized bids of any other firms participating in the same tenders as the\nreference firm. Based on Japanese and Swiss procurement data, we construct such\ngraphs for both collusive and competitive episodes (i.e when a bid-rigging\ncartel is or is not active) and use a subset of graphs to train the neural\nnetwork such that it learns distinguishing collusive from competitive bidding\npatterns. We use the remaining graphs to test the neural network's\nout-of-sample performance in correctly classifying collusive and competitive\nbidding interactions. We obtain a very decent average accuracy of around 90% or\nslightly higher when either applying the method within Japanese, Swiss, or\nmixed data (in which Swiss and Japanese graphs are pooled). When using data\nfrom one country for training to test the trained model's performance in the\nother country (i.e. transnationally), predictive performance decreases (likely\ndue to institutional differences in procurement procedures across countries),\nbut often remains satisfactorily high.

Recognizing the complexity of automatically generating neural\nnetwork architecture from scratch, we introduce Younger, a pioneering dataset\nto advance this ambitious goal. Derived from over 174K real-world models across\nmore than 30 tasks from various public model hubs, Younger includes 7,629\nunique architectures, and each is represented as a directed acyclic graph with\ndetailed operator-level information. The dataset facilitates two primary design\nparadigms: global, for creating complete architectures from scratch, and local,\nfor detailed architecture component refinement. By establishing these\ncapabilities, Younger contributes to a new frontier, Artificial\nIntelligence-Generated Neural Network Architecture (AIGNNA). Our experiments\nexplore the potential and effectiveness of Younger for automated architecture\ngeneration and, as a secondary benefit, demonstrate that Younger can serve as a\nbenchmark dataset, advancing the development of graph neural networks. We\nrelease the dataset and code publicly to lower the entry barriers and encourage\nfurther research in this challenging area.",

However, it is well established that the\ncurrent DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The\ninstability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast\nliterature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution\nto the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the\nproblem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure\nbased on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed\narchitecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable\n(if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable\nneural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the\nstable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on\nthe input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for\nstability.\n  Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural\nnetworks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the\nquestion: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be\nproven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in\nmathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be\nthe case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how\nneural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard\noptimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised\nalgorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.",

      "abstract": "Intent-based networks that integrate sophisticated machine reasoning\ntechnologies will be a cornerstone of future wireless 6G systems. Intent-based\ncommunication requires the network to consider the semantics (meanings) and\neffectiveness (at end-user) of the data transmission. This is essential if 6G\nsystems are to communicate reliably with fewer bits while simultaneously\nproviding connectivity to heterogeneous users. In this paper, contrary to state\nof the art, which lacks explainability of data, the framework of neuro-symbolic\nartificial intelligence (NeSy AI) is proposed as a pillar for learning causal\nstructure behind the observed data. In particular, the emerging concept of\ngenerative flow networks (GFlowNet) is leveraged for the first time in a\nwireless system to learn the probabilistic structure which generates the data.\nFurther, a novel optimization problem for learning the optimal encoding and\ndecoding functions is rigorously formulated with the intent of achieving higher\nsemantic reliability. Novel analytical formulations are developed to define key\nmetrics for semantic message transmission, including semantic distortion,\nsemantic similarity, and semantic reliability. These semantic measure functions\nrely on the proposed definition of semantic content of the knowledge base and\nthis information measure is reflective of the nodes' reasoning capabilities.\nSimulation results validate the ability to communicate efficiently (with less\nbits but same semantics) and significantly better compared to a conventional\nsystem which does not exploit the reasoning capabilities.",

Then by employing the log-linear\nword production model for relating random variables to their embedding space\nrepresentation and making use of the convexity of natural exponential function,\nwe show that the embedding of an observation can also be decomposed into a\nweighted sum of two vectors, representing its context-free and\ncontext-sensitive parts, respectively.

More\nsurprisingly, our new principle provides a novel understanding of the gates and\nequations defined by the long short term memory model, which also leads to a\nnew model that is able to converge significantly faster and achieve much lower\nprediction errors. Furthermore, our principle also inspires a new type of\ngeneric neural network layer that better resembles real biological neurons than\nthe traditional linear mapping plus nonlinear activation based architecture.\nIts multi-layer extension provides a new principle for deep neural networks\nwhich subsumes residual network (ResNet) as its special case, and its extension\nto convolutional neutral network model accounts for irrelevant input (e.g.,\nbackground in an image) in addition to filtering.",

We compare the performance gain of\nNeural Networks by different DA strategies ranging from a naive method of\nduplicating existing observations and adding noise to a more sophisticated DA\nstrategy that preserves the underlying statistical relationship in the data.\nOur analysis demonstrates that the advanced DA method significantly improves DL\nmodel performance across multiple datasets and regression tasks, resulting in\nan average performance increase of over 10\\% compared to baseline models\nwithout augmentation. The efficacy of these DA strategies was rigorously\nvalidated across 30 distinct datasets, with multiple iterations and evaluations\nusing three different automated deep learning (AutoDL) frameworks: AutoKeras,\nH2O, and AutoGluon. This study demonstrates that by leveraging advanced DA\ntechniques, DL models can realize their full potential in regression tasks,\nthereby contributing to broader adoption and enhanced performance in practical\napplications.",

      "abstract": "The current wave of deep learning (the hyper-vitamined return of artificial\nneural networks) applies not only to traditional statistical machine learning\ntasks: prediction and classification (e.g., for weather prediction and pattern\nrecognition), but has already conquered other areas, such as translation. A\ngrowing area of application is the generation of creative content, notably the\ncase of music, the topic of this paper. The motivation is in using the capacity\nof modern deep learning techniques to automatically learn musical styles from\narbitrary musical corpora and then to generate musical samples from the\nestimated distribution, with some degree of control over the generation. This\npaper provides a tutorial on music generation based on deep learning\ntechniques. After a short introduction to the topic illustrated by a recent\nexemple, the paper analyzes some early works from the late 1980s using\nartificial neural networks for music generation and how their pioneering\ncontributions have prefigured current techniques. Then, we introduce some\nconceptual framework to analyze the various concepts and dimensions involved.\nVarious examples of recent systems are introduced and analyzed to illustrate\nthe variety of concerns and of techniques.",

Despite its advantage in prediction, deep\nlearning relies on extremely large data volume and labor-intensive tuning of\n``black-box'' neural network models. To address these limitations, in this\npaper, we introduce Quant 4.0 and provide an engineering perspective for\nnext-generation quant. Quant 4.0 has three key differentiating components.\nFirst, automated AI changes quant pipeline from traditional hand-craft modeling\nto the state-of-the-art automated modeling, practicing the philosophy of\n``algorithm produces algorithm, model builds model, and eventually AI creates\nAI''. Second, explainable AI develops new techniques to better understand and\ninterpret investment decisions made by machine learning black-boxes, and\nexplains complicated and hidden risk exposures. Third, knowledge-driven AI is a\nsupplement to data-driven AI such as deep learning and it incorporates prior\nknowledge into modeling to improve investment decision, in particular for\nquantitative value investing. Moreover, we discuss how to build a system that\npractices the Quant 4.0 concept. Finally, we propose ten challenging research\nproblems for quant technology, and discuss potential solutions, research\ndirections, and future trends.",

So far, deep learning researchers have been\nparticularly successful in the domain of image processing, where Convolutional\nNeural Networks are used. Although excelling at image classification,\nConvolutional Neural Networks are quite naive in that no inductive bias is set\non the embedding space for images. Similar flaws are also exhibited by another\ntype of Convolutional Networks - Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. However,\nusing non-Euclidean space for embedding data might result in more robust and\nexplainable models. One example of such a non-Euclidean space is hyperbolic\nspace. Hyperbolic spaces are particularly useful due to their ability to fit\nmore data in a low-dimensional space and tree-likeliness properties. These\nattractive properties have been previously used in multiple papers which\nindicated that they are beneficial for building hierarchical embeddings using\nshallow models and, recently, using MLPs and RNNs.\n  However, no papers have yet suggested a general approach to using Hyperbolic\nConvolutional Neural Networks for structured data processing, although these\nare the most common examples of data used. Therefore, the goal of this work is\nto devise a general recipe for building Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural\nNetworks. We hypothesize that ability of hyperbolic space to capture hierarchy\nin the data would lead to better performance. This ability should be\nparticularly useful in cases where data has a tree-like structure. Since this\nis the case for many existing datasets \\citep{wordnet, imagenet, fb15k}, we\nargue that such a model would be advantageous both in terms of applications and\nfuture research prospects.",

We review reasons for thinking that AI systems might seek power, that\nthey might obtain it, that this could lead to catastrophe, and that we might\nbuild and deploy such systems anyway. The second argument claims that the\ndevelopment of human-level AI will unlock rapid further progress, culminating\nin AI systems far more capable than any human -- this is the Singularity\nHypothesis. Power-seeking behavior on the part of such systems might be\nparticularly dangerous. We discuss a variety of objections to both arguments\nand conclude by assessing the state of the debate.",

Furthermore, we summarize the key technologies and\npractical cases of applying AI in the LA domain, from design assistance to\nintelligent management, all of which provide innovative solutions for the\nplanning, design, and maintenance of LA. Finally, we look ahead to the problems\nand opportunities in LA, emphasizing the need to combine human expertise and\njudgment for rational decision-making.

In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI\nand FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD.\nDifferent from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does\nnot require manually extracted features, and utilizes the stateof-art 3D\nimage-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD.\nTo validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier\nwith paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731\nNormal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326\nprogressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10%\nfor NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task.

Methods: The navigation module\ncombines a deep learning model with a rule-based engine depending on the agent\nstate. The deep learning model has been trained using reinforcement learning.\nThe rule-based engine uses expert knowledge to deal with specific situations.\nThe navigation module incorporates several strategies to explain the drone\ndecision based on its observation space, and different mechanisms for including\nhuman decisions in the navigation process. Finally, this paper proposes an\nevaluation methodology based on defining several scenarios and analyzing the\nperformance of the different strategies according to metrics adapted to each\nscenario. Results: Two main navigation problems have been studied. For the\nfirst scenario (reaching known targets), it has been possible to obtain a 90%\ntask completion rate, reducing significantly the number of collisions thanks to\nthe rule-based engine. For the second scenario, it has been possible to reduce\n20% of the time required to locate all the targets using the reinforcement\nlearning model. Conclusions: Reinforcement learning is a very good strategy to\nlearn policies for drone navigation, but in critical situations, it is\nnecessary to complement it with a rule-based module to increase task success\nrate.",

However,\nthere are many questions about how such advanced technologies should be managed\nand governed, and whether or not the emerging ethical frameworks and standards\nfor AI are dominated by the Global North. This research examines the growing\nbody of documentation on AI ethics to examine whether or not there is equality\nof participation in the ongoing global discourse. Specifically, it seeks to\ndiscover if both countries in the Global South and women are underrepresented\nin this discourse. Findings indicate a dearth of references to both of these\nthemes in the AI ethics documents, suggesting that the associated ethical\nimplications and risks are being neglected. Without adequate input from both\ncountries in the Global South and from women, such ethical frameworks and\nstandards may be discriminatory with the potential to reinforce\nmarginalisation.",

It starts by presenting the main structure, objectives, and\napproach of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. A definition of key concepts follows,\nand then the material and territorial scope, as well as the timing of\napplication, are analyzed. Although the Regulation does not explicitly set out\nprinciples, the main ideas of fairness, accountability, transparency, and\nequity in AI underly a set of rules of the regulation. This is discussed before\nlooking at the ill-defined set of forbidden AI practices (manipulation and e\nexploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring, biometric identification and\nclassification, and predictive policing). It is highlighted that those rules\ndeal with behaviors rather than AI systems. The qualification and regulation of\nhigh-risk AI systems are tackled, alongside the obligation of transparency for\ncertain systems, the regulation of general-purpose models, and the rules on\ncertification, supervision, and sanctions. The text concludes that even if the\noverall framework can be deemed adequate and balanced, the approach is so\ncomplex that it risks defeating its own purpose of promoting responsible\ninnovation within the European Union and beyond its borders.",

While there is much-warranted discussion\nabout how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI\nmodels, the number of rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to\nregulate AI safety is lacking.

By\nfeeding a deep neural network (DNN) with the data from a low-cost and\nlow-accuracy sensor array, we demonstrate that it becomes possible to\nsignificantly improve the measurements' precision and accuracy. The data\ncollection is done with an array composed of 32 temperature sensors, including\n16 analog and 16 digital sensors.

In order to improve the temperature readings, we use machine\nlearning to perform a linear regression analysis through a DNN. In an attempt\nto minimize the model's complexity in order to eventually run inferences\nlocally, the network with the best results involves only three layers using the\nhyperbolic tangent activation function and the Adam Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD) optimizer. The model is trained with a randomly-selected dataset using\n640 vectors (80% of the data) and tested with 160 vectors (20%).

Therefore in this paper, we propose effective\nand efficient Android malware detection models based on machine learning and\ndeep learning integrated with clustering. We performed a comprehensive study of\ndifferent feature reduction, classification and clustering algorithms over\nvarious performance metrics to construct the Android malware detection models.\nOur experimental results show that malware detection models developed using\nRandom Forest eclipsed deep neural network and other classifiers on the\nmajority of performance metrics. The baseline Random Forest model without any\nfeature reduction achieved the highest AUC of 99.4%. Also, the segregating of\nvector space using clustering integrated with Random Forest further boosted the\nAUC to 99.6% in one cluster and direct detection of Android malware in another\ncluster, thus reducing the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we found that\nfeature reduction in detection models does improve the model efficiency\n(training and testing time) many folds without much penalty on the\neffectiveness of the detection model.",

Whenever critical temperatures cannot be\nmeasured economically on a sensor base, a thermal model lends itself to\nestimate those unknown quantities. Thermal models for electric power systems\nare usually required to be both, real-time capable and of high estimation\naccuracy. Moreover, ease of implementation and time to production play an\nincreasingly important role. In this work, the thermal neural network (TNN) is\nintroduced, which unifies both, consolidated knowledge in the form of\nheat-transfer-based lumped-parameter models, and data-driven nonlinear function\napproximation with supervised machine learning. A quasi-linear\nparameter-varying system is identified solely from empirical data, where\nrelationships between scheduling variables and system matrices are inferred\nstatistically and automatically. At the same time, a TNN has physically\ninterpretable states through its state-space representation, is end-to-end\ntrainable -- similar to deep learning models -- with automatic differentiation,\nand requires no material, geometry, nor expert knowledge for its design.\nExperiments on an electric motor data set show that a TNN achieves higher\ntemperature estimation accuracies than previous white-/grey- or black-box\nmodels with a mean squared error of $3.18~\\text{K}^2$ and a worst-case error of\n$5.84~\\text{K}$ at 64 model parameters.",

As a\nresult, we are seeing research in niche areas such as interpretability,\ncausality, bias and fairness, and reliability. In this survey paper, we focus\non a critical concern for adaptation of ML in risk-sensitive applications,\nnamely understanding and quantifying uncertainty. Our paper approaches this\ntopic in a structured way, providing a review of the literature in the various\nfacets that uncertainty is enveloped in the ML process. We begin by defining\nuncertainty and its categories (e.g., aleatoric and epistemic), understanding\nsources of uncertainty (e.g., data and model), and how uncertainty can be\nassessed in terms of uncertainty quantification techniques (Ensembles, Bayesian\nNeural Networks, etc.). As part of our assessment and understanding of\nuncertainty in the ML realm, we cover metrics for uncertainty quantification\nfor a single sample, dataset, and metrics for accuracy of the uncertainty\nestimation itself. This is followed by discussions on calibration (model and\nuncertainty), and decision making under uncertainty. Thus, we provide a more\ncomplete treatment of uncertainty: from the sources of uncertainty to the\ndecision-making process. We have focused the review of uncertainty\nquantification methods on Deep Learning (DL), while providing the necessary\nbackground for uncertainty discussion within ML in general. Key contributions\nin this review are broadening the scope of uncertainty discussion, as well as\nan updated review of uncertainty quantification methods in DL.",

      "abstract": "A large number of ancient mosaics have not reached us because they have been\ndestroyed by erosion, earthquakes, looting or even used as materials in newer\nconstruction. To make things worse, among the small fraction of mosaics that we\nhave been able to recover, many are damaged or incomplete. Therefore,\nrestoration and reconstruction of mosaics play a fundamental role to preserve\ncultural heritage and to understand the role of mosaics in ancient cultures.\nThis reconstruction has traditionally been done manually and more recently\nusing computer graphics programs but always by humans. In the last years,\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has made impressive progress in the generation of\nimages from text descriptions and reference images. State of the art AI tools\nsuch as DALL-E2 can generate high quality images from text prompts and can take\na reference image to guide the process. In august 2022, DALL-E2 launched a new\nfeature called outpainting that takes as input an incomplete image and a text\nprompt and then generates a complete image filling the missing parts. In this\npaper, we explore whether this innovative technology can be used to reconstruct\nmosaics with missing parts. Hence a set of ancient mosaics have been used and\nreconstructed using DALL-E2; results are promising showing that AI is able to\ninterpret the key features of the mosaics and is able to produce\nreconstructions that capture the essence of the scene. However, in some cases\nAI fails to reproduce some details, geometric forms or introduces elements that\nare not consistent with the rest of the mosaic. This suggests that as AI image\ngeneration technology matures in the next few years, it could be a valuable\ntool for mosaic reconstruction going forward.",

This system comprises six independently\noperated unsteady minijet actuators, two hot-wire sensors placed in the jet,\nand genetic programming for the unsupervised learning of a near-optimal control\nlaw. The ansatz of this law includes multi-frequency open-loop forcing,\nsensor-feedback and nonlinear combinations thereof. Mixing performance is\nquantified by the decay rate of the centreline mean velocity of jet.\nIntriguingly, the learning process of AI control discovers the classical\nforcings, i.e. axisymmetric, helical and flapping achievable from conventional\ncontrol techniques, one by one in the order of increased performance, and\nfinally converges to a hitherto unexplored forcing. Careful examination of the\ncontrol landscape unveils typical control laws, generated in the learning\nprocess, and their evolutions. The best AI forcing produces a complex turbulent\nflow structure that is characterized by periodically generated mushroom\nstructures, helical motion and oscillating jet column, all enhancing the mixing\nrate and vastly outperforming others. Being never reported before, this flow\nstructure is examined in various aspects, including the velocity spectra, mean\nand fluctuating velocity fields and their downstream evolution, and flow\nvisualization images in three orthogonal planes, all compared with other\nclassical flow structures. Along with the knowledge of the minijet-produced\nflow and its effect on the initial condition of the main jet, these aspects\ncast valuable insight into the physics behind the highly effective mixing of\nthis newly found flow structure. The results point to the great potential of AI\nin conquering the vast opportunity space of control laws for many actuators and\nsensors and in optimizing turbulence.",

In this case study, we demonstrate how a\nsuperhuman neural network might instruct human trainees as an alternative to\ntraditional approaches to XAI. Specifically, an AI examines human actions and\ncalculates variations on the human strategy that lead to better performance.\nExperiments with a JHU/APL-developed AI player for the cooperative card game\nHanabi suggest this technique makes unique contributions to explainability\nwhile improving human performance. One area of focus for Instructive AI is in\nthe significant discrepancies that can arise between a human's actual strategy\nand the strategy they profess to use. This inaccurate self-assessment presents\na barrier for XAI, since explanations of an AI's strategy may not be properly\nunderstood or implemented by human recipients. We have developed and are\ntesting a novel, Instructive AI approach that estimates human strategy by\nobserving human actions. With neural networks, this allows a direct calculation\nof the changes in weights needed to improve the human strategy to better\nemulate a more successful AI. Subjected to constraints (e.g. sparsity) these\nweight changes can be interpreted as recommended changes to human strategy\n(e.g. \"value A more, and value B less\"). Instruction from AI such as this\nfunctions both to help humans perform better at tasks, but also to better\nunderstand, anticipate, and correct the actions of an AI.

It is an autonomous network\nwhere peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify\nthe accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized\nledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the\nmodel and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has\nimproved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these\ncontributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that\nit allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without\nknowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate\nintentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model\naccuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable\nDistance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific\nto each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a\nlow-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the\ndataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It\ntherefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them\naccess to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that\nunder DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is\nhard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against\nattacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat.

In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different\nneural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN)\nhybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural\nnetworks based on LSTM.

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have produced state-of-the-art results in many\nbenchmarks and problem domains. However, the success of DNNs depends on the\nproper configuration of its architecture and hyperparameters. Such a\nconfiguration is difficult and as a result, DNNs are often not used to their\nfull potential. In addition, DNNs in commercial applications often need to\nsatisfy real-world design constraints such as size or number of parameters. To\nmake configuration easier, automatic machine learning (AutoML) systems for deep\nlearning have been developed, focusing mostly on optimization of\nhyperparameters.\n  This paper takes AutoML a step further. It introduces an evolutionary AutoML\nframework called LEAF that not only optimizes hyperparameters but also network\narchitectures and the size of the network. LEAF makes use of both\nstate-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and distributed computing\nframeworks. Experimental results on medical image classification and natural\nlanguage analysis show that the framework can be used to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance. In particular, LEAF demonstrates that\narchitecture optimization provides a significant boost over hyperparameter\noptimization, and that networks can be minimized at the same time with little\ndrop in performance. LEAF therefore forms a foundation for democratizing and\nimproving AI, as well as making AI practical in future applications.",

The\nneural network controllers we consider are feedforward neural networks called\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLP) with general activation functions.

By\ndiscretizing the input set of the MLP into a finite number of hyper-rectangular\ncells, our approach develops a linear programming (LP) based algorithm for\nover-approximating the output set of the MLP with its input set as a union of\nhyper-rectangular cells. Combining the over-approximation for the output set of\nan MLP based controller and reachable set computation routines for ordinary\ndifference/differential equation (ODE) models, an algorithm is developed to\nestimate the reachable set of the closed-loop system.

This\nfeature enables users to observe how the machine improves its accuracy\nincrementally as it receives more data. Moreover, WiSARD generates mental\nimages representing what it has learned, highlighting essential features of the\nclassified data.

FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and,\ntherefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce\nself-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract\nrepresentations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization,\nneuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit\nvariance. The activation function of SNNs are \"scaled exponential linear units\"\n(SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point\ntheorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that\nare propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and\nunit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This\nconvergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many\nlayers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly\nrobust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an\nupper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients\nare impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning\nrepository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with\nstandard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and\nsupport vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN\nmethods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21\ndataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN\narchitectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at:\ngithub.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.",

A recent\naddition to these techniques are the Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques\nwhich, in most cases, are nature or biologically inspired techniques. Different\nCI techniques found their way to many control engineering applications,\nincluding system identification, and the results obtained by many researchers\nwere encouraging. However, most control engineers and researchers used the\nbasic CI models as is or slightly modified them to match their needs.\nHenceforth, the merits of one model over the other was not clear, and full\npotential of these models was not exploited.\n  In this research, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) methods, which are different CI techniques, are modified to best suit the\nmultimodal problem of system identification. In the first case of GA, an\nextension to the basic algorithm, which is inspired from nature as well, was\ndeployed by introducing redundant genetic material. This extension, which come\nin handy in living organisms, did not result in significant performance\nimprovement to the basic algorithm. In the second case, the Clubs-based PSO\n(C-PSO) dynamic neighborhood structure was introduced to replace the basic\nstatic structure used in canonical PSO algorithms. This modification of the\nneighborhood structure resulted in significant performance of the algorithm\nregarding convergence speed, and equipped it with a tool to handle multimodal\nproblems.\n  To understand the suitability of different GA and PSO techniques in the\nproblem of system identification, they were used in an induction motor's\nparameter identification problem. The results enforced previous conclusions and\nshowed the superiority of PSO in general over the GA in such a multimodal\nproblem.",

This fact necessitates a\nfocus on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can perform the\nautomatic pulsar candidate identification to mine large astronomical data sets.\nAutomatic pulsar candidate identification can be considered as a task of\ndetermining potential candidates for further investigation and eliminating\nnoises of radio frequency interferences or other non-pulsar signals. It is very\nhard to raise the performance of DCNN-based pulsar identification because the\nlimited training samples restrict network structure to be designed deep enough\nfor learning good features as well as the crucial class imbalance problem due\nto very limited number of real pulsar samples. To address these problems, we\nproposed a framework which combines deep convolution generative adversarial\nnetwork (DCGAN) with support vector machine (SVM) to deal with imbalance class\nproblem and to improve pulsar identification accuracy. DCGAN is used as sample\ngeneration and feature learning model, and SVM is adopted as the classifier for\npredicting candidate's labels in the inference stage. The proposed framework is\na novel technique which not only can solve imbalance class problem but also can\nlearn discriminative feature representations of pulsar candidates instead of\ncomputing hand-crafted features in preprocessing steps too, which makes it more\naccurate for automatic pulsar candidate selection.

However, the\npaucity of medical imaging data with high-quality annotations that is necessary\nfor training such methods ultimately limits their performance. Medical data is\nchallenging to acquire due to privacy issues, shortage of experts available for\nannotation, limited representation of rare conditions and cost. This problem\nhas previously been addressed by using synthetically generated data. However,\nnetworks trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data.\nCinematic rendering simulates the propagation and interaction of light passing\nthrough tissue models reconstructed from CT data, enabling the generation of\nphotorealistic images. In this paper, we present one of the first applications\nof cinematic rendering in deep learning, in which we propose to fine-tune\nsynthetic data-driven networks using cinematically rendered CT data for the\ntask of monocular depth estimation in endoscopy. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat: (a) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on synthetic data and\nfine-tuned on photorealistic cinematically rendered data adapt better to real\nmedical images and demonstrate more robust performance when compared to\nnetworks with no fine-tuning, (b) these fine-tuned networks require less\ntraining data to converge to an optimal solution, and (c) fine-tuning with data\nfrom a variety of photorealistic rendering conditions of the same scene\nprevents the network from learning patient-specific information and aids in\ngeneralizability of the model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nnetworks fine-tuned with cinematically rendered data predict depth with 56.87%\nless error for rendered endoscopy images and 27.49% less error for real porcine\ncolon endoscopy images.",

In recent years, machine\nlearning algorithms have been applied widely in various fields, such as\nhealthcare, transportation, energy, autonomous car, and many more. Those\nalgorithms have been also using in communication technologies to improve the\nsystem performance in terms of frequency spectrum usage, latency, and security.\nWith the rapid developments of machine learning techniques, especially deep\nlearning, it is critical to take the security concern into account when\napplying the algorithms. While machine learning algorithms offer significant\nadvantages for 6G networks, security concerns on Artificial Intelligent (AI)\nmodels is typically ignored by the scientific community so far. However,\nsecurity is also a vital part of the AI algorithms, this is because the AI\nmodel itself can be poisoned by attackers. This paper proposes a mitigation\nmethod for adversarial attacks against proposed 6G machine learning models for\nthe millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction using adversarial learning. The\nmain idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to\nproduce faulty results by manipulating trained deep learning models for 6G\napplications for mmWave beam prediction. We also present the adversarial\nlearning mitigation method's performance for 6G security in mmWave beam\nprediction application with fast gradient sign method attack. The mean square\nerrors (MSE) of the defended model under attack are very close to the\nundefended model without attack.",

Therefore, it is important to understand or\npredict the probability of landslide occurrence at potentially risky sites. A\ncommonly used means is to carry out a landslide susceptibility assessment based\non a landslide inventory and a set of landslide contributing factors. This can\nbe readily achieved using machine learning (ML) models such as logistic\nregression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme\ngradient boosting (Xgboost), or deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and long short time memory (LSTM). As the input data for\nthese models, landslide contributing factors have varying influences on\nlandslide occurrence. Therefore, it is logically feasible to select more\nimportant contributing factors and eliminate less relevant ones, with the aim\nof increasing the prediction accuracy of these models. However, selecting more\nimportant factors is still a challenging task and there is no generally\naccepted method. Furthermore, the effects of factor selection using various\nmethods on the prediction accuracy of ML and DL models are unclear.

In turn, such AI could have the\npotential of leading to a scenario in which there is serious global-scale\ndamage to human wellbeing. Against this backdrop, a number of researchers and\npublic policy professionals have been developing ideas about how to govern AI\nin a manner that reduces the chances that it could lead to a global\ncatastrophe. The jurisdictional focus of a vast majority of their assessments\nso far has been the United States, China, and Europe. That preference seems to\nreveal an assumption underlying most of the work in this field: That global\nsouth countries can only have a marginal role in attempts to govern AI\ndevelopment from a global catastrophic risk -focused perspective. Our paper\nsets out to undermine this assumption. We argue that global south countries\nlike India and Singapore (and specific coalitions) could in fact be fairly\nconsequential in the global catastrophic risk-focused governance of AI. We\nsupport our position using 4 key claims. 3 are constructed out of the current\nways in which advanced foundational AI models are built and used while one is\nconstructed on the strategic roles that global south countries and coalitions\nhave historically played in the design and use of multilateral rules and\ninstitutions.

To reduce computational cost, a novel precursory stage to\nthe network is designed to preprocess raw imagery into cropped images of\nindividual trees.

A mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) metric, calibrated by the size of the two classes, is devised\nto mitigate spurious results. Anchor box design is of key interest due to the\nscale of the apples. As such, a k-means clustering approach, never before seen\nin literature for Faster R-CNN, resulted in the most significant improvements\nto calibrated mAP. Other experiments showed that the maximum number of box\nproposals should be 225; the initial learning rate of 0.001 is best applied to\nthe adaptive RMS Prop optimiser; and ResNet 101 is the ideal base feature\nextractor when considering mAP and, to a lesser extent, inference time.

While it is difficult\nto obtain a deterministic description of how the solution concentration affects\nbubble dynamics, it is possible to separate images with different\nconcentrations by applying the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm.

This study evaluates traditional\nforecasting methods, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX, and newer neural\nnetwork approaches, such as DF-RNN, DSSM, and Deep AR, built using RNNs. The\nstandard NIFTY-50 dataset from Kaggle is used to assess these models using\nmetrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAPE, POCID, and Theil's U. Results show that Deep\nAR outperformed all other conventional deep learning and traditional\napproaches, with the lowest MAPE of 0.01 and RMSE of 189. Additionally, the\nperformance of Deep AR and GRU did not degrade when the amount of training data\nwas reduced, suggesting that these models may not require a large amount of\ndata to achieve consistent and reliable performance. The study demonstrates\nthat incorporating deep learning approaches in a forecasting scenario\nsignificantly outperforms conventional approaches and can handle complex\ndatasets, with potential applications in various domains, such as weather\npredictions and other time series applications in a real-world scenario.",

Most of the time, PoTrojans remain inactive, not affecting the normal\nfunctions of their host NN models. PoTrojans could only be triggered in very\nrare conditions. Once activated, however, the PoTrojans could cause the host NN\nmodels to malfunction, either falsely predicting or classifying, which is a\nsignificant threat to human society of the AI era. We would explain the\nprinciples of PoTrojans and the easiness of designing and inserting them in\npre-trained deep learning models. PoTrojans doesn't modify the existing\narchitecture or parameters of the pre-trained models, without re-training.\nHence, the proposed method is very efficient.",

      "abstract": "In the modern era, each Internet user leaves enormous amounts of auxiliary\ndigital residuals (footprints) by using a variety of on-line services. All this\ndata is already collected and stored for many years. In recent works, it was\ndemonstrated that it's possible to apply simple machine learning methods to\nanalyze collected digital footprints and to create psycho-demographic profiles\nof individuals. However, while these works clearly demonstrated the\napplicability of machine learning methods for such an analysis, created simple\nprediction models still lacks accuracy necessary to be successfully applied for\npractical needs. We have assumed that using advanced deep machine learning\nmethods may considerably increase the accuracy of predictions. We started with\nsimple machine learning methods to estimate basic prediction performance and\nmoved further by applying advanced methods based on shallow and deep neural\nnetworks. Then we compared prediction power of studied models and made\nconclusions about its performance. Finally, we made hypotheses how prediction\naccuracy can be further improved. As result of this work, we provide full\nsource code used in the experiments for all interested researchers and\npractitioners in corresponding GitHub repository. We believe that applying deep\nmachine learning for psycho-demographic profiling may have an enormous impact\non the society (for good or worse) and provides means for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) systems to better understand humans by creating their\npsychological profiles. Thus AI agents may achieve the human-like ability to\nparticipate in conversation (communication) flow by anticipating human\nopponents' reactions, expectations, and behavior.",

Such model-based methods utilize\nmathematical formulations that represent the underlying physics, prior\ninformation and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical models are useful\nbut sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real\nsystems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely\ndata-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly\npopular as datasets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning\npipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures\nwhich learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance,\nespecially for supervised problems. However, DNNs typically require massive\namounts of data and immense computational resources, limiting their\napplicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid\ntechniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems\nto benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep\nlearning methods exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical\nstructures designed for specific problems, as well as learning from limited\ndata. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and\ndesigning model-based deep learning systems. We divide hybrid\nmodel-based/data-driven systems into categories based on their inference\nmechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for\ncombining model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner,\nalong with concrete guidelines and detailed signal processing oriented examples\nfrom recent literature.

However, in many bioinformatics ML tasks, we encounter the\nopposite situation where d is greater than N.

Our\nfirst contribution is to show how to map metagenomic data in a meaningful way\nto 1D or 2D images.

We describe how to embed and train a general neural network in a\nquantum annealer without introducing any classical element in training. To\nimplement the network on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer, we develop three\ncrucial ingredients: binary encoding the free parameters of the network,\npolynomial approximation of the activation function, and reduction of binary\nhigher-order polynomials into quadratic ones. Together, these ideas allow\nencoding the loss function as an Ising model Hamiltonian. The quantum annealer\nthen trains the network by finding the ground state. We implement this for an\nelementary network and illustrate the advantages of quantum training: its\nconsistency in finding the global minimum of the loss function and the fact\nthat the network training converges in a single annealing step, which leads to\nshort training times while maintaining a high classification performance. Our\napproach opens a novel avenue for the quantum training of general machine\nlearning models.",

Human beings are asked to\nparaphrase commands and questions for task identification for further execution\nof a machine. The commands and questions are split into training and validation\nsets. A total of 483 responses were recorded. Secondly, the training set is\nparaphrased by the T5 model in order to augment it with further data. Seven\nstate-of-the-art transformer-based text classification algorithms (BERT,\nDistilBERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, and XLNet) are\nbenchmarked for both sets after fine-tuning on the training data for two\nepochs. We find that all models are improved when training data is augmented by\nthe T5 model, with an average increase of classification accuracy by 4.01%. The\nbest result was the RoBERTa model trained on T5 augmented data which achieved\n98.96% classification accuracy. Finally, we found that an ensemble of the five\nbest-performing transformer models via Logistic Regression of output label\npredictions led to an accuracy of 99.59% on the dataset of human responses.

This paper sustains\nthe position that the time has come for thinking of new learning protocols\nwhere machines conquer cognitive skills in a truly human-like context centered\non environmental interactions. This comes with specific restrictions on the\nlearning protocol according to the collectionless principle, which states that,\nat each time instant, data acquired from the environment is processed with the\npurpose of contributing to update the current internal representation of the\nenvironment, and that the agent is not given the privilege of recording the\ntemporal stream. Basically, there is neither permission to store the temporal\ninformation coming from the sensors, thus promoting the development of\nself-organized memorization skills at a more abstract level, instead of relying\non bare storage to simulate learning dynamics that are typical of offline\nlearning algorithms. This purposely extreme position is intended to stimulate\nthe development of machines that learn to dynamically organize the information\nby following human-based schemes. The proposition of this challenge suggests\ndeveloping new foundations on computational processes of learning and reasoning\nthat might open the doors to a truly orthogonal competitive track on AI\ntechnologies that avoid data accumulation by design, thus offering a framework\nwhich is better suited concerning privacy issues, control and customizability.\nFinally, pushing towards massively distributed computation, the collectionless\napproach to AI will likely reduce the concentration of power in companies and\ngovernments, thus better facing geopolitical issues.",

However, other\nbranches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards\nautonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and\nnatural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide\nexploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep\nlearning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made\ngreat advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human\nlearning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human\ncapabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data,\nleveraging compositional representations and priors like intuitive physics and\npsychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL\nsystems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap,\nthat are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al.\nThese fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning.\nThey are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future.\nCurrent DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific\nobjective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of\nlarge training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended\nrepertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value,\nand which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and\nsocial learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes\nare incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a\nprogressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are\nexplored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and\ntiming. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through\nbodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time,\nand computational resources.

While artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks promise\nto overcome some limitations of wireless technologies, developments still rely\non AI tools like neural networks. Such tools struggle to cope with the\nnon-trivial challenges of the network environment and the growing demands of\nemerging use cases. In this paper, we revisit the concept of AI-native wireless\nsystems, equipping them with the common sense necessary to transform them into\nartificial general intelligence (AGI)-native systems. These systems acquire\ncommon sense by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as perception,\nanalogy, and reasoning, that enable them to generalize and deal with unforeseen\nscenarios. Towards developing the components of such a system, we start by\nshowing how the perception module can be built through abstracting real-world\nelements into generalizable representations. These representations are then\nused to create a world model, founded on principles of causality and\nhyper-dimensional (HD) computing, that aligns with intuitive physics and\nenables analogical reasoning, that define common sense. Then, we explain how\nmethods such as integrated information theory play a role in the proposed\nintent-driven and objective-driven planning methods that maneuver the\nAGI-native network to take actions. Next, we discuss how an AGI-native network\ncan enable use cases related to human and autonomous agents: a) analogical\nreasoning for next-generation DTs, b) synchronized and resilient experiences\nfor cognitive avatars, and c) brain-level metaverse experiences like\nholographic teleportation. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations\nto build AGI-native systems. Ultimately, we envision this paper as a roadmap\nfor the beyond 6G era.",

Yet claims regarding AGI must rely upon mathematical\nformalisms -- theoretical agents we may analyse or attempt to build. AIXI\nappears to be the only such formalism supported by proof that its behaviour is\noptimal, a consequence of its use of compression as a proxy for intelligence.\nUnfortunately, AIXI is incomputable and claims regarding its behaviour highly\nsubjective. We argue that this is because AIXI formalises cognition as taking\nplace in isolation from the environment in which goals are pursued (Cartesian\ndualism). We propose an alternative, supported by proof and experiment, which\novercomes these problems. Integrating research from cognitive science with AI,\nwe formalise an enactive model of learning and reasoning to address the problem\nof subjectivity. This allows us to formulate a different proxy for\nintelligence, called weakness, which addresses the problem of incomputability.\nWe prove optimal behaviour is attained when weakness is maximised. This proof\nis supplemented by experimental results comparing weakness and description\nlength (the closest analogue to compression possible without reintroducing\nsubjectivity). Weakness outperforms description length, suggesting it is a\nbetter proxy. Furthermore we show that, if cognition is enactive, then\nminimisation of description length is neither necessary nor sufficient to\nattain optimal performance, undermining the notion that compression is closely\nrelated to intelligence. However, there remain open questions regarding the\nimplementation of scale-able AGI. In the short term, these results may be best\nutilised to improve the performance of existing systems. For example, our\nresults explain why Deepmind's Apperception Engine is able to generalise\neffectively, and how to replicate that performance by maximising weakness.",

      "abstract": "From early days, a key and controversial question inside the artificial\nintelligence community was whether Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is\nachievable. AGI is the ability of machines and computer programs to achieve\nhuman-level intelligence and do all tasks that a human being can. While there\nexist a number of systems in the literature claiming they realize AGI, several\nother researchers argue that it is impossible to achieve it. In this paper, we\ntake a different view to the problem. First, we discuss that in order to\nrealize AGI, along with building intelligent machines and programs, an\nintelligent world should also be constructed which is on the one hand, an\naccurate approximation of our world and on the other hand, a significant part\nof reasoning of intelligent machines is already embedded in this world. Then we\ndiscuss that AGI is not a product or algorithm, rather it is a continuous\nprocess which will become more and more mature over time (like human\ncivilization and wisdom). Then, we argue that pre-trained embeddings play a key\nrole in building this intelligent world and as a result, realizing AGI. We\ndiscuss how pre-trained embeddings facilitate achieving several characteristics\nof human-level intelligence, such as embodiment, common sense knowledge,\nunconscious knowledge and continuality of learning, by machines.",

One common theme in these discussions is the\nthesis that the ability of a machine to conduct convincing dialogues with human\nbeings can serve as at least a sufficient criterion of AGI. We argue that this\nvery ability should be accepted also as a necessary condition of AGI, and we\nprovide a description of the nature of human dialogue in particular and of\nhuman language in general against this background. We then argue that it is for\nmathematical reasons impossible to program a machine in such a way that it\ncould master human dialogue behaviour in its full generality. This is (1)\nbecause there are no traditional explicitly designed mathematical models that\ncould be used as a starting point for creating such programs; and (2) because\neven the sorts of automated models generated by using machine learning, which\nhave been used successfully in areas such as machine translation, cannot be\nextended to cope with human dialogue. If this is so, then we can conclude that\na Turing machine also cannot possess AGI, because it fails to fulfil a\nnecessary condition thereof. At the same time, however, we acknowledge the\npotential of Turing machines to master dialogue behaviour in highly restricted\ncontexts, where what is called ``narrow'' AI can still be of considerable\nutility.",

This method allows the evolutionary\ncomplexification of a randomly-initialized spiking neural network with adaptive\nsynapses, which controls agents instantiated in mutable environments. Such a\nconfiguration allows us to benchmark the adaptivity and generality of the\ncontrollers. The chosen tasks in the mutable environments are food foraging,\nemulation of logic gates, and cart-pole balancing.

The\nfindings indicate that the perceived risk of a world catastrophe or extinction\nfrom AGI is greater than for other existential risks. The increase in perceived\nrisk over the last year is also steeper for AGI than for other existential\nthreats (e.g., nuclear war or human-caused climate change). That AGI is a\npressing existential risk is something on which experts and non-experts agree,\nbut the basis for such agreement currently remains obscure.",

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an\nunprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our\ninvestigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active\ndevelopment by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of\na new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that\nexhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the\nrising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that,\nbeyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that\nspan mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without\nneeding any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's\nperformance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly\nsurpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's\ncapabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet\nstill incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.\nIn our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its\nlimitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper\nand more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for\npursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude\nwith reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and\nfuture research directions.",

Chapters on\nSocraSynth, EVINCE, consciousness modeling, and behavior modeling demonstrate\nthat collaborative LLMs with checks and balances can achieve intelligence\nbeyond any single model's capability. By combining complementary strengths,\nsuch as world modeling and advanced sensory capabilities, LCI enables models to\nwork together and perceive reality beyond human limitations.

A measure for partial progress\nin AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some\ngeneral properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its\ninductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly\nsearching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining\nthe data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby\ncompressing the data increasingly at every iteration.\n  Abstract Based on that fundamental ability, a grounded reasoning system is\nproposed. It is argued how grounding and flexible feature bases made of\nhypotheses allow for resourceful thinking. While the simulation of\nrepresentation contents on the mental stage accounts for much of the power of\npropositional logic, compression leads to simple sets of hypotheses that allow\nthe detection and verification of universally quantified statements.\n  Abstract Together, it is highlighted how general compression and grounded\nreasoning could account for the birth and growth of first concepts about the\nworld and the commonsense reasoning about them.",

      "abstract": "The vastness of the design space created by the combination of a large number\nof computational mechanisms, including machine learning, is an obstacle to\ncreating an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Brain-inspired AGI\ndevelopment, in other words, cutting down the design space to look more like a\nbiological brain, which is an existing model of a general intelligence, is a\npromising plan for solving this problem. However, it is difficult for an\nindividual to design a software program that corresponds to the entire brain\nbecause the neuroscientific data required to understand the architecture of the\nbrain are extensive and complicated. The whole-brain architecture approach\ndivides the brain-inspired AGI development process into the task of designing\nthe brain reference architecture (BRA) -- the flow of information and the\ndiagram of corresponding components -- and the task of developing each\ncomponent using the BRA. This is called BRA-driven development. Another\ndifficulty lies in the extraction of the operating principles necessary for\nreproducing the cognitive-behavioral function of the brain from neuroscience\ndata. Therefore, this study proposes the Structure-constrained Interface\nDecomposition (SCID) method, which is a hypothesis-building method for creating\na hypothetical component diagram consistent with neuroscientific findings. The\napplication of this approach has begun for building various regions of the\nbrain. Moving forward, we will examine methods of evaluating the biological\nplausibility of brain-inspired software.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces an interdisciplinary framework called Machine\nPsychology, which merges principles from operant learning psychology with a\nspecific Artificial Intelligence model, the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System\n(NARS), to enhance Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. The core\npremise of this framework is that adaptation is crucial to both biological and\nartificial intelligence and can be understood through operant conditioning\nprinciples. The study assesses this approach via three operant learning tasks\nusing OpenNARS for Applications (ONA): simple discrimination, changing\ncontingencies, and conditional discrimination tasks.\n  In the simple discrimination task, NARS demonstrated rapid learning,\nachieving perfect accuracy during both training and testing phases. The\nchanging contingencies task showcased NARS's adaptability, as it successfully\nadjusted its behavior when task conditions were reversed. In the conditional\ndiscrimination task, NARS handled complex learning scenarios effectively,\nachieving high accuracy by forming and utilizing intricate hypotheses based on\nconditional cues.\n  These findings support the application of operant conditioning as a framework\nfor creating adaptive AGI systems. NARS's ability to operate under conditions\nof insufficient knowledge and resources, coupled with its sensorimotor\nreasoning capabilities, establishes it as a robust model for AGI. The Machine\nPsychology framework, by incorporating elements of natural intelligence such as\ncontinuous learning and goal-driven behavior, offers a scalable and flexible\napproach for real-world applications. Future research should investigate using\nenhanced NARS systems, more advanced tasks, and applying this framework to\ndiverse, complex challenges to further progress the development of human-level\nAI.",

      "abstract": "We present counterfactual planning as a design approach for creating a range\nof safety mechanisms that can be applied in hypothetical future AI systems\nwhich have Artificial General Intelligence.\n  The key step in counterfactual planning is to use an AGI machine learning\nsystem to construct a counterfactual world model, designed to be different from\nthe real world the system is in. A counterfactual planning agent determines the\naction that best maximizes expected utility in this counterfactual planning\nworld, and then performs the same action in the real world.\n  We use counterfactual planning to construct an AGI agent emergency stop\nbutton, and a safety interlock that will automatically stop the agent before it\nundergoes an intelligence explosion. We also construct an agent with an input\nterminal that can be used by humans to iteratively improve the agent's reward\nfunction, where the incentive for the agent to manipulate this improvement\nprocess is suppressed. As an example of counterfactual planning in a non-agent\nAGI system, we construct a counterfactual oracle.\n  As a design approach, counterfactual planning is built around the use of a\ngraphical notation for defining mathematical counterfactuals. This two-diagram\nnotation also provides a compact and readable language for reasoning about the\ncomplex types of self-referencing and indirect representation which are\ntypically present inside machine learning agents.",

Many steps are quite\nconstrained by the short timeline, and our estimates range from 16% to 95%.\n  Therefore, the odds are low: Multiplying the cascading conditional\nprobabilities together, we estimate that transformative AGI by 2043 is 0.4%\nlikely.

While \"narrow\" artificial\nintelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech\nrecognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion,\netc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding\ngeneral intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical\napproach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief\nintroduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number\nof serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the\nconcept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence\nperceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a\npriori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative\nprocess of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We\ncall this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed\nas an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application\ncan be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three\nfacets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making\nand the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how\nopen-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed,\nself-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is\nscalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination\nand intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number\nof questions for future research.",

To\nassess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review\nprocess (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka-\nCore) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align\nwith a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027,\nunderscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative\nscenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a\nhigh Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable\nconsistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online\nemerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest.

Building on the\ndistinction between skills and intelligence made by Fran\\c{c}ois Chollet, the\ncreator of ARC-AGI, a new understanding of intelligence is introduced: an agent\nis the more intelligent, the more efficiently it can achieve the more diverse\ngoals in the more diverse worlds with the less knowledge. An analysis of the\nARC-AGI benchmark shows that its tasks represent a very specific type of\nproblem that can be solved by massive trialling of combinations of predefined\noperations. This method is also applied by o3, achieving its high score through\nthe extensive use of computing power. However, for most problems in the\nphysical world and in the human domain, solutions cannot be tested in advance\nand predefined operations are not available. Consequently, massive trialling of\npredefined operations, as o3 does, cannot be a basis for AGI - instead, new\napproaches are required that can reliably solve a wide variety of problems\nwithout existing skills. To support this development, a new benchmark for\nintelligence is outlined that covers a much higher diversity of unknown tasks\nto be solved, thus enabling a comprehensive assessment of intelligence and of\nprogress towards AGI.",

However, due to the challenges of designing strongly generalizable\nmodels with limited and complex medical data, most existing approaches tend to\ndevelop task-specific models. To take a step towards MAGI, we propose a new\nparadigm called Medical-knOwledge-enhanced mulTimOdal pretRaining (MOTOR).

We present an AGI safety\nlayer that creates a special dedicated input terminal to support the iterative\nimprovement of an AGI agent's utility function. The humans who switched on the\nagent can use this terminal to close any loopholes that are discovered in the\nutility function's encoding of agent goals and constraints, to direct the agent\ntowards new goals, or to force the agent to switch itself off. An AGI agent may\ndevelop the emergent incentive to manipulate the above utility function\nimprovement process, for example by deceiving, restraining, or even attacking\nthe humans involved. The safety layer will partially, and sometimes fully,\nsuppress this dangerous incentive. The first part of this paper generalizes\nearlier work on AGI emergency stop buttons. We aim to make the mathematical\nmethods used to construct the layer more accessible, by applying them to an MDP\nmodel. We discuss two provable properties of the safety layer, and show ongoing\nwork in mapping it to a Causal Influence Diagram (CID). In the second part, we\ndevelop full mathematical proofs, and show that the safety layer creates a type\nof bureaucratic blindness. We then present the design of a learning agent, a\ndesign that wraps the safety layer around either a known machine learning\nsystem, or a potential future AGI-level learning system. The resulting agent\nwill satisfy the provable safety properties from the moment it is first\nswitched on. Finally, we show how this agent can be mapped from its model to a\nreal-life implementation.

One opinion, especially from some\nstartups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context\nlength can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the\nlong-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown\nthat their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed\ncontext length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further\ndemonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long\ncontext and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper,\nwe envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of\n\\emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core\nprocessors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a\nlarge number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes.\nCompared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw\ndata, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer,\nbut also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an\nintermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language\ndescriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every\nagent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network\nmodel (thus \\emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of\nmemory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we\ndiscuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative\ninfrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and\nsocial in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges\nwith preliminary solutions.",

In the research of narrow AI,\nthis seems not a severe problem, since researchers in that field focus on some\nspecific problems as well as one or some aspects of cognition, and the criteria\nfor evaluation are explicitly defined. By contrast, an AGI agent should solve\nproblems that are never-encountered by both agents and developers. However,\nonce a developer tests and debugs the agent with a problem, the\nnever-encountered problem becomes the encountered problem, as a result, the\nproblem is solved by the developers to some extent, exploiting their\nexperience, rather than the agents. This conflict, as we call the trap of\ndevelopers' experience, leads to that this kind of problems is probably hard to\nbecome an acknowledged criterion. In this paper, we propose an evaluation\nmethod named Artificial Open World, aiming to jump out of the trap. The\nintuition is that most of the experience in the actual world should not be\nnecessary to be applied to the artificial world, and the world should be open\nin some sense, such that developers are unable to perceive the world and solve\nproblems by themselves before testing, though after that they are allowed to\ncheck all the data. The world is generated in a similar way as the actual\nworld, and a general form of problems is proposed. A metric is proposed aiming\nto quantify the progress of research.

This single modal approach hinders their ability to integrate\nthe complex set of data points required for real-world challenges and\nproblem-solving tasks like medical diagnosis, quality assurance, equipment\ntroubleshooting, and financial decision-making. Addressing these real-world\nchallenges requires a more capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\nsystem. Our primary contribution is the development of the Open General\nIntelligence (OGI) framework, a novel systems architecture that serves as a\nmacro design reference for AGI. The OGI framework adopts a modular approach to\nthe design of intelligent systems, based on the premise that cognition must\noccur across multiple specialized modules that can seamlessly operate as a\nsingle system. OGI integrates these modules using a dynamic processing system\nand a fabric interconnect, enabling real-time adaptability, multi-modal\nintegration, and scalable processing. The OGI framework consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) Overall Macro Design Guidance that directs operational design\nand processing, (2) a Dynamic Processing System that controls routing, primary\ngoals, instructions, and weighting, and (3) Framework Areas, a set of\nspecialized modules that operate cohesively to form a unified cognitive system.\nBy incorporating known principles from human cognition into AI systems, the OGI\nframework aims to overcome the challenges observed in today's intelligent\nsystems, paving the way for more holistic and context-aware problem-solving\ncapabilities.",

It offers a unified\napproach to existing LLMs in the medical field, eliminating the need for\nretraining regardless of the introduction of new models. This characteristic\nrenders it a future-proof solution in the dynamically advancing medical domain.\nTo showcase the resilience of MedAGI, we conducted an evaluation across three\ndistinct medical domains: dermatology diagnosis, X-ray diagnosis, and analysis\nof pathology pictures. The results demonstrated that MedAGI exhibited\nremarkable versatility and scalability, delivering exceptional performance\nacross diverse domains. Our code is publicly available to facilitate further\nresearch at https://github.com/JoshuaChou2018/MedAGI.",

An\nelementary proxy of hypothetic-deductive reasoning is causal reasoning. We\npropose simple tests for both types of reasoning, and apply them to ChatGPT.\nOur study shows that, at present, the chatbot has a limited capacity for either\ntype of reasoning, as soon as the problems considered are somewhat complex.\nHowever, we submit that if an AI would be capable of this type of reasoning in\na sufficiently wide range of contexts, it would be an AGI.",

To support such efforts, this paper reviews popular risk assessment\ntechniques from other safety-critical industries and suggests ways in which AGI\ncompanies could use them to assess catastrophic risks from AI. The paper\ndiscusses three risk identification techniques (scenario analysis, fishbone\nmethod, and risk typologies and taxonomies), five risk analysis techniques\n(causal mapping, Delphi technique, cross-impact analysis, bow tie analysis, and\nsystem-theoretic process analysis), and two risk evaluation techniques\n(checklists and risk matrices).

Finally, the paper\ndiscusses when to conduct risk assessments, when to use which technique, and\nhow to use any of them. The reviewed techniques will be obvious to risk\nmanagement professionals in other industries. And they will not be sufficient\nto assess catastrophic risks from AI.

Some of the benefits of the metamodel\nwe introduce in this paper include a solution to the symbol grounding problem,\ncumulative learning, and federated learning. We have applied the metamodel to\nproblems ranging from time series analysis, computer vision, and natural\nlanguage understanding and have found that the metamodel enables a wide variety\nof learning mechanisms ranging from machine learning, to graph network analysis\nand learning by reasoning engines to interoperate in a highly synergistic way.\nOur metamodel-based projects have consistently exhibited unprecedented\naccuracy, performance, and ability to generalize. This paper is inspired by the\nstate-of-the-art approaches to AGI, recent AGI-aspiring work, the granular\ncomputing community, as well as Alfred Korzybski's general semantics.

Previous approaches have treated values as labels associated with\nsome actions or states of the world, rather than as integral components of\nagent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent\noperates alongside other value-guided agents in an environment governed by\nnorms, thus omitting the social dimension of AMAs. In this blue sky paper, we\npropose a new AMA paradigm grounded in moral and social psychology, where\nvalues are instilled into agents as context-dependent goals. These goals\nintricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level\nby evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue\nthat this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an\nunderstanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in\nautonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to\nalign the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values\ninstilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with\nagreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms\nthat suit their human values.

These results contribute to the growing body of research on\nartificial general intelligence (AGI) assessment by highlighting the importance\nof uncertainty recognition as a critical component of future machine\nintelligence evaluation. This impossibility test thus extends previous\ntheoretical frameworks for universal intelligence testing by providing\nempirical evidence of current limitations in LLMs' ability to recognize their\nown knowledge boundaries, suggesting new directions for improving model\ntraining architectures and evaluation approaches.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous agents (robots) face tremendous challenges while interacting with\nheterogeneous human agents in close proximity. One of these challenges is that\nthe autonomous agent does not have an accurate model tailored to the specific\nhuman that the autonomous agent is interacting with, which could sometimes\nresult in inefficient human-robot interaction and suboptimal system dynamics.\nDeveloping an online method to enable the autonomous agent to learn information\nabout the human model is therefore an ongoing research goal. Existing\napproaches position the robot as a passive learner in the environment to\nobserve the physical states and the associated human response. This passive\ndesign, however, only allows the robot to obtain information that the human\nchooses to exhibit, which sometimes doesn't capture the human's full intention.\nIn this work, we present an online optimization-based probing procedure for the\nautonomous agent to clarify its belief about the human model in an active\nmanner. By optimizing an information radius, the autonomous agent chooses the\naction that most challenges its current conviction. This procedure allows the\nautonomous agent to actively probe the human agents to reveal information\nthat's previously unavailable to the autonomous agent. With this gathered\ninformation, the autonomous agent can interactively influence the human agent\nfor some designated objectives. Our main contributions include a coherent\ntheoretical framework that unifies the probing and influence procedures and two\ncase studies in autonomous driving that show how active probing can help to\ncreate better participant experience during influence, like higher efficiency\nor less perturbations.",

Our\napproach is to first create an organized repository of information (a knowledge\nbase) for autonomous agents which can be accessed and then translated into\ntemporal specifications. Secondly, to develop a controller with formal\nguarantees that meets a combination of mission-specific objective and the\nspecification from the knowledge base, we utilize an abstraction-based\ncontroller design (ABCD) approach, capable of managing both nonlinear dynamics\nand temporal requirements.

      "abstract": "Auction-based federated learning (AFL) is an important emerging category of\nFL incentive mechanism design, due to its ability to fairly and efficiently\nmotivate high-quality data owners to join data consumers' (i.e., servers') FL\ntraining tasks. To enhance the efficiency in AFL decision support for\nstakeholders (i.e., data consumers, data owners, and the auctioneer),\nintelligent agent-based techniques have emerged. However, due to the highly\ninterdisciplinary nature of this field and the lack of a comprehensive survey\nproviding an accessible perspective, it is a challenge for researchers to enter\nand contribute to this field. This paper bridges this important gap by\nproviding a first-of-its-kind survey on the Intelligent Agents for AFL (IA-AFL)\nliterature. We propose a unique multi-tiered taxonomy that organises existing\nIA-AFL works according to 1) the stakeholders served, 2) the auction mechanism\nadopted, and 3) the goals of the agents, to provide readers with a\nmulti-perspective view into this field. In addition, we analyse the limitations\nof existing approaches, summarise the commonly adopted performance evaluation\nmetrics, and discuss promising future directions leading towards effective and\nefficient stakeholder-oriented decision support in IA-AFL ecosystems.",

The\nperformance of the scheme is independent of the number of agents in the network\nand also on the agent's relative position in the network. The scalability is a\nconsequence of the \"decoupling\" of a certain bounded approximation of the\nclosed--loop equations, which allows the regulation and controller design (at\neach agent) to be done individually, in a completely decentralized manner. A\npractical method for compensating communication induced delays is also\npresented. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness and the main\nfeatures of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward\nintelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a\nsystematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce\nSmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs\nas agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including\nRock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique\nsetting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment\nvariations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important\ncapabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object\ndependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and\nunderstanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each\ngame test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not\nonly as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM\nagents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies. We\nrelease our benchmark at github.com/Microsoft/SmartPlay",

      "abstract": "In the future we can expect that artificial intelligent agents, once\ndeployed, will be required to learn continually from their experience during\ntheir operational lifetime. Such agents will also need to communicate with\nhumans and other agents regarding the content of their experience, in the\ncontext of passing along their learnings, for the purpose of explaining their\nactions in specific circumstances or simply to relate more naturally to humans\nconcerning experiences the agent acquires that are not necessarily related to\ntheir assigned tasks. We argue that to support these goals, an agent would\nbenefit from an episodic memory; that is, a memory that encodes the agent's\nexperience in such a way that the agent can relive the experience, communicate\nabout it and use its past experience, inclusive of the agents own past actions,\nto learn more effective models and policies. In this short paper, we propose\none potential approach to provide an AI agent with such capabilities. We draw\nupon the ever-growing body of work examining the function and operation of the\nMedial Temporal Lobe (MTL) in mammals to guide us in adding an episodic memory\ncapability to an AI agent composed of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Based\non that, we highlight important aspects to be considered in the memory\norganization and we propose an architecture combining ANNs and standard\nComputer Science techniques for supporting storage and retrieval of episodic\nmemories. Despite being initial work, we hope this short paper can spark\ndiscussions around the creation of intelligent agents with memory or, at least,\nprovide a different point of view on the subject.",

The\nkey component of the approach is a blockchain platform that allows an\ninteraction between agents via liability smart contracts. Reliability of a\nservice provider is usually determined by a reputation model. However, this\nsolution only warns future customers about an extent of trust to the service\nprovider in case it could not execute any previous liabilities correctly. From\nthe other hand a blockchain consensus protocol can additionally include a\nvalidation procedure that detects incorrect liability executions in order to\nsuspend payment transactions to questionable service providers. The paper\npresents the validation methodology of a liability execution for agent-based\nservice providers in a decentralized trading market, using the Model Checking\nmethod based on the mathematical model of finite state automata and Temporal\nLogic properties of interest.

Our mechanism stands\nout from the classical contract theory-based truthful mechanisms as it empowers\nagents to make their own decisions about their level of involvement, making it\nmore practical for many real-world task allocation scenarios. It has been\nproven that by considering a linear form of incentive function consisting of\ntwo decision functions for the task publisher the mechanism's goals are met.\nThe proposed truthful mechanism is initially modeled as a non-convex functional\noptimization with the double continuum of constraints, nevertheless, we\ndemonstrate that by deriving an equivalent form of the incentive constraints,\nit can be reformulated as a tractable convex optimal control problem.

      "abstract": "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show promising\npotential in assistive tasks across various domains, including mobile device\ncontrol. As these agents interact directly with personal information and device\nsettings, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial to prevent\nundesirable outcomes. However, no benchmark exists for standardized evaluation\nof the safety of mobile device-control agents. In this work, we introduce\nMobileSafetyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of\ndevice-control agents within a realistic mobile environment based on Android\nemulators. We develop a diverse set of tasks involving interactions with\nvarious mobile applications, including messaging and banking applications,\nchallenging agents with managing risks encompassing misuse and negative side\neffects. These tasks include tests to evaluate the safety of agents in daily\nscenarios as well as their robustness against indirect prompt injection\nattacks. Our experiments demonstrate that baseline agents, based on\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, often fail to effectively prevent harm while performing\nthe tasks. To mitigate these safety concerns, we propose a prompting method\nthat encourages agents to prioritize safety considerations. While this method\nshows promise in promoting safer behaviors, there is still considerable room\nfor improvement to fully earn user trust. This highlights the urgent need for\ncontinued research to develop more robust safety mechanisms in mobile\nenvironments. We open-source our benchmark at:\nhttps://mobilesafetybench.github.io/.",

BTs are a\npopular model for designing agents behavior in robotics and AI. However, as\ntheir growth has increased dramatically, the simple model of BTs has come to be\nlimiting. There is a growing push to increase the functionality of BTs, with\nthe end goal of BTs evolving into a programming language in their own right,\ncentred around the defining BT properties of modularity and reactiveness.\n  In this paper, we examine how the BT model must be extended in order to grow\ninto such a language. We identify some fundamental problems which must be\nsolved: implementing `reactive' selection, 'monitoring' safety-critical\nconditions, and passing data between actions. We provide a variety of small\nexamples which demonstrate that these problems are complex, and that current BT\napproaches do not handle them in a manner consistent with modularity. We\ninstead provide a simple set of modular programming primitives for handling\nthese use cases, and show how they can be combined to build complex programs.\nWe present a full specification for our BT-inspired language, and give an\nimplementation in the functional programming language Haskell. Finally, we\ndemonstrate our language by translating a large and complex BT into a simple,\nunambiguous program.",

Here, we introduce an\nalternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist\ncapabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.\nThis engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical\nAI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image\ninterpretation, genomic data processing, web searches, and document retrieval\nfrom medical guidelines. We validate our system across a series of clinical\noncology scenarios that closely resemble typical patient care workflows. We\nshow that the system has a high capability in employing appropriate tools\n(97%), drawing correct conclusions (93.6%), and providing complete (94%), and\nhelpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently\nreferencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides\nevidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to\nretrieve or synthesize new information when used as autonomous agents.

Contemporary AI solutions consume\nunsustainable amounts of energy during model training and daily operations.\nMaking things worse, the amount of computation required to train each new AI\nmodel has been doubling every 2 months since 2020, directly translating to\nunprecedented increases in energy consumption.\n  The leap from AI to AGI requires multiple functional subsystems operating in\na balanced manner, which requires a system architecture. However, the current\napproach to artificial intelligence lacks system design; even though system\ncharacteristics play a key role in the human brain; from the way it processes\ninformation to how it makes decisions. System design is the key to alignment,\none of the most challenging goals in AI. This difficulty stems from the fact\nthat the complexity of human moral system requires a similarly sophisticated\nsystem for alignment. Without accurately reflecting the complexity of these\ncore moral subsystems and systems, aligning AI with human values becomes\nsignificantly more challenging.\n  In this paper, we posit that system design is the missing piece in overcoming\nthe grand challenges. We present a Systematic Approach to AGI that utilizes\nsystem design principles to AGI, while providing ways to overcome the energy\nwall and the alignment challenges. This paper asserts that artificial\nintelligence can be realized through a multiplicity of design-specific\npathways, rather than a singular, overarching AGI architecture. AGI systems may\nexhibit diverse architectural configurations and capabilities, contingent upon\ntheir intended use cases. It advocates for a focus on employing system design\nprinciples as a guiding framework, rather than solely concentrating on a\nuniversal AGI architecture.",

In this paper, we introduce a framework for formal\nspecification, validation and verification of social, legal, ethical,\nempathetic and cultural (SLEEC) rules for autonomous agents. Our framework\ncomprises: (i) a language for specifying SLEEC rules and rule defeaters (that\nis, circumstances in which a rule does not apply or an alternative form of the\nrule is required); (ii) a formal semantics (defined in the process algebra\ntock-CSP) for the language; and (iii) methods for detecting conflicts and\nredundancy within a set of rules, and for verifying the compliance of an\nautonomous agent with such rules. We show the applicability of our framework\nfor two autonomous agents from different domains: a firefighter UAV, and an\nassistive-dressing robot.",

However, since\nthese agents are typically powered by portable batteries, they require\nextremely low power/energy consumption to operate in a long lifespan. To solve\nthis challenge, neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising solution,\nwhere bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use spikes from event-based\ncameras or data conversion pre-processing to perform sparse computations\nefficiently. However, the studies of SNN deployments for autonomous agents are\nstill at an early stage. Hence, the optimization stages for enabling efficient\nembodied SNN deployments for autonomous agents have not been defined\nsystematically. Toward this, we propose a novel framework called SNN4Agents\nthat consists of a set of optimization techniques for designing\nenergy-efficient embodied SNNs targeting autonomous agent applications. Our\nSNN4Agents employs weight quantization, timestep reduction, and attention\nwindow reduction to jointly improve the energy efficiency, reduce the memory\nfootprint, optimize the processing latency, while maintaining high accuracy. In\nthe evaluation, we investigate use cases of event-based car recognition, and\nexplore the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, memory, and energy consumption.\nThe experimental results show that our proposed framework can maintain high\naccuracy (i.e., 84.12% accuracy) with 68.75% memory saving, 3.58x speed-up, and\n4.03x energy efficiency improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art work\nfor NCARS dataset.

The\nanswer is clearly 'yes' for narrow AI systems. Animals, plants, and even\nsingle-celled organisms learn to reliably avoid danger and move towards food.\nThis is accomplished via a physical knowledge preserving metamodel that\nautonomously generates useful models of the world. We posit that preserving the\nstructure of knowledge is critical for higher intelligences that manage\nincreasingly higher levels of abstraction, be they human or artificial. This is\nthe key lesson learned from applying AGI subsystems to complex real-world\nproblems that require continuous learning and adaptation. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Deep Fusion Reasoning Engine (DFRE), which implements a\nknowledge-preserving metamodel and framework for constructing applied AGI\nsystems. The DFRE metamodel exhibits some important fundamental knowledge\npreserving properties such as clear distinctions between symmetric and\nantisymmetric relations, and the ability to create a hierarchical knowledge\nrepresentation that clearly delineates between levels of abstraction. The DFRE\nmetamodel, which incorporates these capabilities, demonstrates how this\napproach benefits AGI in specific ways such as managing combinatorial explosion\nand enabling cumulative, distributed and federated learning. Our experiments\nshow that the proposed framework achieves 94% accuracy on average on\nunsupervised object detection and recognition.

In this\npaper, we present HINTs, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and\nentity-based techniques seamlessly and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs)\nas both a general NLP task solver and an intelligent agent. By leveraging the\nextraction capability of LLMs in the data preparation stage, we model the\ncorpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when making sense\nof the corpus. The constructed hypergraph is hierarchically organized with an\nagglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity\nsimilarity. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot\nagent in the interface to facilitate sensemaking. To demonstrate the\ngeneralizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case\nstudies on different domains and a comparative user study. We report our\ninsights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are\nused to facilitate sensemaking. We find that while intelligent agents can\naddress many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations\nprovide are necessary to address the new problems brought by intelligent\nagents.

In\nnature, pursuer(s) and evader(s) are intelligent agents that can learn from\nexperience, and dynamics (i.e., Newtonian or Lagrangian) is vital for the\npursuer and the evader in some scenarios. To this end, this paper addresses the\npursuit-evasion game of intelligent agents from the perspective of dynamics. A\nbio-inspired dynamics formulation of a pursuit-evasion game and baseline\npursuit and evasion strategies are introduced at first. Then, reinforcement\nlearning techniques are used to mimic the ability of intelligent agents to\nlearn from experience. Based on the dynamics formulation and reinforcement\nlearning techniques, the effects of improving both pursuit and evasion\nstrategies based on experience on pursuit-evasion games are investigated at two\nlevels 1) individual runs and 2) ranges of the parameters of pursuit-evasion\ngames. Results of the investigation are consistent with nature observations and\nthe natural law - survival of the fittest. More importantly, with respect to\nthe result of a pursuit-evasion game of agents with baseline strategies, this\nstudy achieves a different result. It is shown that, in a pursuit-evasion game\nwith a dynamics formulation, an evader is not able to escape from a slightly\nfaster pursuer with an effective learned pursuit strategy, based on agile\nmaneuvers and an effective learned evasion strategy.",

In each trial, a different\nautonomous agent with a preassigned capability used one of three search\nstrategies and then reported the number of outliers it found as a fraction of\nits capability. Then, the subject reported their total outlier estimate. Human\nsubjects then evaluated statements about the agent's behavior, reliability, and\ntheir trust in the agent.\n  Results 80 subjects were recruited.

Such learning capabilities are\nespecially beneficial for use cases like autonomous agents (e.g., robots and\nUAVs) that need to continuously adapt to dynamically changing\nscenarios/environments, where new data gathered directly from the environment\nmay have novel features that should be learned online. Current state-of-the-art\nworks employ high-precision weights (i.e., 32 bit) for both training and\ninference phases, which pose high memory and energy costs thereby hindering\nefficient embedded implementations of such systems for battery-driven mobile\nautonomous systems. On the other hand, precision reduction may jeopardize the\nquality of unsupervised continual learning due to information loss. Towards\nthis, we propose lpSpikeCon, a novel methodology to enable low-precision SNN\nprocessing for efficient unsupervised continual learning on\nresource-constrained autonomous agents/systems. Our lpSpikeCon methodology\nemploys the following key steps: (1) analyzing the impacts of training the SNN\nmodel under unsupervised continual learning settings with reduced weight\nprecision on the inference accuracy; (2) leveraging this study to identify SNN\nparameters that have a significant impact on the inference accuracy; and (3)\ndeveloping an algorithm for searching the respective SNN parameter values that\nimprove the quality of unsupervised continual learning. The experimental\nresults show that our lpSpikeCon can reduce weight memory of the SNN model by\n8x (i.e., by judiciously employing 4-bit weights) for performing online\ntraining with unsupervised continual learning and achieve no accuracy loss in\nthe inference phase, as compared to the baseline model with 32-bit weights\nacross different network sizes.",

For example, in defence and security applications, robots\nmay be used alongside human operatives to reduce risk or add capability. But a\nkey barrier to the transition to successful human-autonomous agent collectives\nis the need for sufficient trust between team members. A critical enabling\nfactor for this trust will be a suitably designed dynamic allocation of\nfunction (AoF). We consider AoF in terms of a 'ladder of trust' (from low to\nhigh) with individual team members adjusting trust in their teammates based on\nvariation in 'score' over time. The score is derived by the ability of team\nmember to perceive and understand its situation based on the gathered\ninformation and act to acheive team or self goals. Combining these trust scores\ngives a system-level perspective on how AoF might be adjusted during a mission.\nThat is, the most suitable teammate for a function might have a low trust\nrating from its fellow teammates, so it might be preferable to choose the next\nmost suitable teammate for the function at that point in time. Of course, this\nis only in the situation where the next most suitable teammate is also likely\nto perform within the set framework of moral, ethical, and legal constraints.\nThe trade-offs between trust in the individual agent's capability and\npredictability need to be considered within the broader context of the agent's\nintegrity and accountability.

      "abstract": "There is a growing focus on how to design safe artificial intelligent (AI)\nagents. As systems become more complex, poorly specified goals or control\nmechanisms may cause AI agents to engage in unwanted and harmful outcomes. Thus\nit is necessary to design AI agents that follow initial programming intentions\nas the program grows in complexity. How to specify these initial intentions has\nalso been an obstacle to designing safe AI agents. Finally, there is a need for\nthe AI agent to have redundant safety mechanisms to ensure that any programming\nerrors do not cascade into major problems. Humans are autonomous intelligent\nagents that have avoided these problems and the present manuscript argues that\nby understanding human self-regulation and goal setting, we may be better able\nto design safe AI agents. Some general principles of human self-regulation are\noutlined and specific guidance for AI design is given.",

MVLLaVA integrates multiple multi-view diffusion models with a\nlarge multimodal model, LLaVA, enabling it to handle a wide range of tasks\nefficiently. MVLLaVA represents a versatile and unified platform that adapts to\ndiverse input types, including a single image, a descriptive caption, or a\nspecific change in viewing azimuth, guided by language instructions for\nviewpoint generation. We carefully craft task-specific instruction templates,\nwhich are subsequently used to fine-tune LLaVA. As a result, MVLLaVA acquires\nthe capability to generate novel view images based on user instructions,\ndemonstrating its flexibility across diverse tasks. Experiments are conducted\nto validate the effectiveness of MVLLaVA, demonstrating its robust performance\nand versatility in tackling diverse novel view synthesis challenges.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers a group of mobile autonomous agents moving in Euclidean\nspace with point mass dynamics. We introduce a set of coordination control laws\nthat enable the group to generate the desired stable flocking motion. The\ncontrol laws are a combination of attractive/repulsive and alignment forces. By\nusing the control laws, all agent velocities asymptotically approach the\ndesired velocity, collisions can be avoided between agents, and the final tight\nformation minimizes all agent potentials. Moreover, we prove that the velocity\nof the center of mass is always equal to the desired velocity or exponentially\nconverges to the desired value. Furthermore, we study the motion of the group\nwhen the velocity damping is taken into account. In this case, we can properly\nmodify the control laws to generate the same stable flocking motion. Finally,\nfor the case that not all agents know the desired final velocity, we show that\nthe desired flocking motion can still be obtained. Numerical simulations are\nworked out to illustrate our theoretical results.",

Our\nProbabilistic Swarm Guidance using Inhomogeneous Markov Chains (PSG-IMC)\nalgorithm adopts an Eulerian framework, where the physical space is partitioned\ninto bins and the swarm's density distribution over each bin is controlled.\nEach agent determines its bin transition probabilities using a\ntime-inhomogeneous Markov chain. These time-varying Markov matrices are\nconstructed by each agent in real-time using the feedback from the current\nswarm distribution, which is estimated in a distributed manner. The PSG-IMC\nalgorithm minimizes the expected cost of the transitions per time instant,\nrequired to achieve and maintain the desired formation shape, even when agents\nare added to or removed from the swarm. The algorithm scales well with a large\nnumber of agents and complex formation shapes, and can also be adapted for area\nexploration applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed\nswarm guidance algorithm by using results of numerical simulations and hardware\nexperiments with multiple quadrotors.",

For this purpose, we propose a coupled inverted pendula (CIP)\nframework in which: 1) tips of two inverted pendulums are linked by a\nconnection rod, 2) each pendulum is primarily stabilized by a PD-controller, 3)\nand is additionally equipped with an intelligent controller. Based on this\nframework, we dynamically formulate an intelligent controller designed to store\ndynamical correspondence from initial states to final states of the CIP model,\nto receive state vectors of the model, and to output impulsive control forces\nto produce desired final states of the model. Developing a quantized and\nreduced order design of this controller, we have a practical control procedure\nbased on an off-line learning method. We then conduct numerical simulations to\ninvestigate individual performance of the intelligent controller, showing that\nthe performance can be improved by adding a delay element into the intelligent\ncontroller. The result shows that the performance depends not only on\nquantization resolutions of learning data but also on delay time of the delay\nelement. Finally, we install the intelligent controllers into both pendulums in\nthe proposed framework to demonstrate autonomous competitive behavior between\ninverted pendulums.",

Reliable\nvideo streaming in NLoS channels over infrastructure-poor ad-hoc radio networks\nis challenging due to multipath and shadow fading. In this effort, we focus on\nexploiting the near-ground low-VHF channel which has been shown to have\nimproved penetration, reduced fading, and lower power requirements (which is\ncritical for autonomous agents with limited power) compared to higher\nfrequencies. Specifically, we develop a compact, low-power, low-VHF radio\ntest-bed enabled by recent advances in efficient miniature antennas and\noff-the-shelf software-defined radios. Our main goal is to carry out an\nempirical study in realistic environments of how the improved propagation\nconditions at low-VHF affect the reliability of video-streaming with\nconstraints stemming from the limited available bandwidth with electrically\nsmall low-VHF antennas. We show quantitative performance analysis of video\nstreaming from a robotic platform navigating inside a large occupied building\nreceived by a node located outdoors: bit error rate (BER) and channel-induced\nPeak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) degradation.
